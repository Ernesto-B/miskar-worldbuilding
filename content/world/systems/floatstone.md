## Overview
An extremely valuable mineral found only in the [[regions/aetheris-isles/index|Aetheris Isles]], mined from floatstone fields and coveted across societies.

<div class="rulescard">

- Raw floatstone is light, durable, and floats inside the [[world/systems/ascension-zone]] when sufficient material is present.
- Purified floatstone does not float but can expand the Ascension Zone.
- Supply is limited and expensive, accessible mainly to middle-class Aetherists and above.
- Commercial purification is banned by [[Kingdom of Drakonia|Drakonia]] and [[Grand Republic of Silveid|Silveid]].

## How It Works
- Raw floatstone is extremely durable yet malleable, suited to gear and tools rather than weapon edges; within the Ascension Zone, items with enough floatstone rise naturally.
- Purification refines it into pure floatstone, a steel-like material that expands the Ascension Zone instead of floating and is prized for clandestine weapon crafting.
- The purification process is held by only a few elite figures; its transmission remains opaque.

## Rules & Constraints
- Limited quantity keeps prices high and availability restricted.
- Political pacts ban commercial purification in Drakonia and Silveid, pushing demand to black markets.

## Impact on Society
- Economy: Drives trade monopolies and black-market demand for purified weapons.
- Warfare: Floatstone-based gear enables aerial tactics within the Ascension Zone.
- Daily life: Middle-class and elite Aetherists incorporate floatstone into tools and travel.

## Dangers & Consequences
- Illicit purification risks political retaliation and destabilization of the Ascension Zone if misused.
