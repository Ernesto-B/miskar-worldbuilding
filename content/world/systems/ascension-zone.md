## Overview
Field encircled by the [[locations/aetheris-isles/floatstone-towers]] in the [[regions/aetheris-isles/index|Aetheris Isles]], enabling aerial life and infrastructure.

<div class="rulescard">

- Within the Ascension Zone, unpurified [[world/systems/floatstone]] rises naturally.
- The field is self-regulating but needs periodic recalibration by skilled engineers and scholars.

</div>

## How It Works
- Floatstone’s buoyant interaction with the field lifts sky farms, floating bastions, and airship docks.
- Recalibration of the towers keeps the field stable, aligning energies that maintain lift.

## Rules & Constraints
- Boundaries and strength depend on the tower network and upkeep.

## Impact on Society
- Economy: Supports sky-based agriculture and trade hubs.
- Warfare: Enables elevated fortifications and aerial staging grounds.
- Daily life: Normalizes travel and living above ground for Isles residents.

## Dangers & Consequences
- Neglected recalibration could destabilize floating structures or shrink safe zones.
