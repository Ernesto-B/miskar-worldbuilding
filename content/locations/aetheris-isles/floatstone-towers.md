## Overview
- Monolithic towers said to be gifts from the [[religion/the-three-pillars]], anchoring the [[world/systems/ascension-zone]] and sustaining the Isles.
- Stand as fortified, ancient structures guarded to keep sabotage and monster attacks at bay.

## Description
- Built centuries ago from unidentifiable white or brown stone veined with glowing energy conduits.
- Tower tops hold massive circular platforms with rune-inscribed containers that resonate with the Three Pillars to house purified [[world/systems/floatstone]].
- The purification process used today is only a fragment of the original, long-lost methods.

## Inhabitants
- Stationed engineers, warriors, and scholars living within or around the towers to keep them stable.

## Points of Interest
- Purified Floatstone Nexus cores that generate the Ascension Zone and require constant rituals and maintenance.

## Daily Life
- Continuous maintenance of mechanisms and wards, vigilant patrols, and ritual upkeep to prevent destabilization.

## Factions & Influence
- Guarded by the [[factions/aetheris-isles/ascendant-wardens]], sworn to secrecy and forbidden from sharing tower lore with outsiders; only the most loyal serve.

## History
- Origins contested between advanced ancient builders and divine creation; constructed long before current rulers.
- Significant portions of original technology and magic vanished over time, leaving only partial knowledge of the towers’ construction and purification methods.

## Secrets & Rumors
> [!note]
> Some Wardens whisper of deeper chambers that still hold untouched technology beyond modern understanding.
