## Overview
- Vertical city carved into the crater left when Cascadea’s landmass tore free, thriving in the shadow of its floating counterpart.
- Five stacked [[world/geography/hollow|Hollows]] divide the city by elevation and wealth, creating stark social strata.

## Description
- Streets echo with haggling merchants, clanging forges, and whispered dealings, all confined to the crater’s steep walls.
- Massive metal grates and platform elevators separate each Hollow; higher tiers stay regulated while lower ones slide toward lawlessness.
- City structure follows the crater’s natural ridges formed by the meteor impact.

## Inhabitants
- Beastfolk dominate physically demanding roles in the Ember Ring and Dimming Mire, often exploited by syndicates or arena owners in the Black Depths.
- Humans hold positions needing cunning or magic in the Azure Steps and especially the Sunlit Crown, tying them to Iyresan governance.

## Points of Interest
- **[[assets/maps/map-sunlit-crown.png|The Sunlit Crown]] (First Hollow):** Sunlit district of wealthy citizens, influential merchants, and the ==Council of Hollows==; ornate stone buildings, magical lanterns, and heavy guard presence with documentation or bribes required to enter.
- **[[assets/maps/map-azure-steps.png|The Azure Steps]] (Second Hollow):** Middle-class artisans and tradespeople supported by the Azure Aqueducts delivering fresh water; relatively safe but plagued by thefts and disputes.
- **[[assets/maps/map-ember-ring.png|The Ember Ring]] (Third Hollow):** Industrial heart of forges and smelters powering trade; rough streets see clashes between gangs, with the [[factions/iyresa/black-basin-syndicate]] running smuggling routes.
- **[[assets/maps/map-dimming-mire.png|The Dimming Mire]] (Fourth Hollow):** Impoverished shanties lit by cultivated bioluminescent fungi; home to the Rot Bazaar black market dominated by the Syndicate.
- **[[assets/maps/map-black-depths.png|The Black Depths]] (Fifth Hollow):** Sunless sprawl of tunnels and hideouts; site of the Pit of Despair arena operated by the Syndicate and rumored ancient ruins deeper still.

## Daily Life
- Elevated platforms and grates regulate movement between Hollows, with survival-of-the-fittest attitudes intensifying closer to the crater floor.
- Labor smoke, market noise, and monster alarms mingle with the constant rumble of elevators hauling goods and people.

## Factions & Influence
- The [[factions/iyresa/black-basin-syndicate]] wields major power in lower Hollows through smuggling networks and the Pit of Despair.
- The ==Council of Hollows== governs from the Sunlit Crown with corruption in varying degrees.

## History

## Secrets & Rumors
> [!note]

- The Collapsing Depths: Rumors say the Black Depths are unstable and could collapse the city, a danger officials refuse to admit.
- The Forgotten Crater: Fragments of ancient ruins hide deep below, hinting at Stonefall’s origins for those who brave the darkness.
