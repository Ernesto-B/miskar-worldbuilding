## Overview
- Shallow, clear waters of the [[world/geography/coast-of-iyresa]] supporting villages like [[locations/iyresa/baytown]] with abundant fish and coral.
- Shipwrecks and ruins of a sunken beastfolk city hint at a violent past beneath the tranquil surface.

## Description
- Easy to wade through with thriving underwater life, yet scattered shipwrecks suggest the bay was once deep enough for larger vessels.
- The bay’s northern edge rises into a sheer rock wall leading to the Iyresan Plains above; perilous paths trace the cliff.

## Inhabitants

## Points of Interest
- **Island Shrine:** Tiered pagoda surrounded by stone lanterns on the southeast edge of the bay.
- **The Vertical Wall:** Sheer rock face with risky pathways between the shore and the Iyresan Plains.
- **Sunken City:** Former beastfolk stronghold destroyed by human invaders using devastating magic that collapsed the sea floor and reshaped the bay.

## Daily Life
- Regular fishing sustains nearby settlements; shallow waters allow frequent harvests and easy boat repairs.

## Factions & Influence
- Shrines draw local guardians; human interest in the ruins stirs tension with beastfolk descendants.

## History
- Years of war between beastfolk rulers and human invaders ended when magic fractured the seabed, sinking the city and forming the bay’s shallows.

## Secrets & Rumors
> [!note]
> Shipwrecks may mark deeper channels hidden by the bay’s shifting currents, and some say relics of the beastfolk empire remain untouched.

## Adventure Hooks
- Shrine corruption: caretakers beg for help cleansing the island shrine after thieves or dark forces defile it.
