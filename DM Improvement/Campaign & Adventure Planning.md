## Prepping the setting/world

All settings should be post-apocalyptic in some way. Draw from real history for examples. Then just follow this formula:

- **Height** - The great empire(s) that existed before the fall... a world that was bigger, brighter, better. Players can then learn about this height when exploring ruins, dungeons, etc.
> eg. age of high-tech industry, gods wandered the earth, magic, etc. 

- **Fall** - 
**Shadow** -
