## Improved Scenes/Descriptions
#### For setting the scene, use this formula:
> Sensory detail + problem + implied choice

Example:
> “The tavern is loud enough that conversations blur together—but you notice a sudden hush ripple from the back corner. A scarred man is standing, hand on his knife, staring at a trembling halfling who clearly didn’t mean to spill that drink.”

Now the players don’t need lore—they need to **decide something**.

Rule of thumb:  
If your scene doesn’t suggest _what a player might do next_, it’s incomplete.

#### For descriptions themselves:
You don’t need flowery language. You need **specificity**.
Use the “3 Details Rule”:
For any location or NPC, pick **3 concrete details**, not 10 vague ones.
Bad:
- “Ancient”
- “Dark”
- “Mysterious”

Good:
- “The stone steps are worn concave, like thousands of boots dragged their heels here.”
- “The torchlight doesn’t reach the ceiling—something up there absorbs the glow.”
- “The guard won’t meet your eyes, and keeps rubbing the same spot on his wrist.”

Specific details **anchor imagination**.
If a description ends and **no one needs to choose**, add:
- A time pressure
- A moral tension
- A looming consequence
- Conflicting information

#### Improv after the decision was made:
Step 1: Let the Outcome Land
- Describe the fallout

Step 2: Ask a Neutral Question
- “Who notices her first?” or “Who’s closest to the body?”
- This pulls players into ownership.

Step 3: Identify 1–2 Consequence Vectors
After any decision, ask yourself:
- **Who is affected?**
- **Who benefits?**
- **Who is angry?**
- **Who now has leverage?**
You only need **one** to move forward.

Step 4: Turn a Consequence into a New Problem
You don’t push them toward a plot.  
You present a **new unstable situation**.

## Player Investment
Every meaningful action should do _something_:
- NPC attitude shifts
- New information unlocked
- A future complication introduced

Example:  
If they intimidate a shopkeeper:
- He gives the info—but warns the gang that someone’s asking questions

Now the world remembers them.
Players invest when they feel:
> “What we do matters.”


## Simple Practice Exercise (10 Minutes, Huge Payoff)
Do this between sessions:
1. Pick **one location** from your world
2. Write:
    - 1 sensory detail
    - 1 immediate problem
    - 1 NPC want or fear
3. Practice saying it **out loud**, once

That’s it.
You’re training:
- Brevity
- Situation-first thinking
- Confidence in delivery


Gold opens doors.
Examples:
- City entry fees
- Guild membership
- Travel permits
- Avoiding legal trouble
- Private audiences

Make players _choose_ between bribes and consequences.

## Gold Usage
- Charge for information that reduces risk.
	Examples:
	- Dungeon maps
	- Monster weaknesses
	- Political secrets
	- Safe routes
	
	Gold → better odds.

- Gold opens doors.

	Make players _choose_ between bribes and consequences.

- Hirelings & Specialists: Gold buys competence.
	Examples:
	- Guides
	- Scribes
	- Healers
	- Mercenaries
	- Craftspeople
	Make hirelings:
	- Useful
	- Fragile
	- Opinionated

- Bases, Holdings, and Strongholds
	Examples:
	- Safehouse
	- Tavern
	- Workshop
	- Tower
	Costs:
	- Purchase
	- Repairs
	- Upgrades
	- Staff
	
	This gives the party something to invest in emotionally.

- Training and item identity
	Examples:
	- Train to increase proficiency in a skill, tools, weapons. 
	- Train to increase ability mod?? OP??
	- Identify item service

- Lifestyle costs
	Frame Lifestyle as a Question of “Where and How Do You Live?”
	Instead of:
	“Choose a lifestyle tier.”
	Ask:
	“Where are you staying while you’re in town?”
	Then describe **options**, not prices.
	
	Example (In-Character Framing)
> 	“You could sleep in the common room of the Crooked Tankard—cheap, loud, and crowded.  
> 	There are private rooms upstairs if you want quiet.  
> 	Or you could stay at the Silver Swan, where merchants and minor nobles tend to gather.” 	

After they choose, _then_ translate to gold **quietly**.
