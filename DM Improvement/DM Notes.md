## Improved Scenes/Descriptions
#### For setting the scene, use this formula:
> Sensory detail + problem + implied choice

Example:
> “The tavern is loud enough that conversations blur together—but you notice a sudden hush ripple from the back corner. A scarred man is standing, hand on his knife, staring at a trembling halfling who clearly didn’t mean to spill that drink.”

Now the players don’t need lore—they need to **decide something**.

Rule of thumb:  
If your scene doesn’t suggest _what a player might do next_, it’s incomplete.

#### For descriptions themselves:
You don’t need flowery language. You need **specificity**.
Use the “3 Details Rule”:
For any location or NPC, pick **3 concrete details**, not 10 vague ones.
Bad:
- “Ancient”
- “Dark”
- “Mysterious”

Good:
- “The stone steps are worn concave, like thousands of boots dragged their heels here.”
- “The torchlight doesn’t reach the ceiling—something up there absorbs the glow.”
- “The guard won’t meet your eyes, and keeps rubbing the same spot on his wrist.”

Specific details **anchor imagination**.
Good to incorporate the senses, and using similes to compare descriptions to real-world experiences we might have had.
