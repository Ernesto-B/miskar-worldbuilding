# Summary
The cave that the party started out in.

# Location
In the forest between [[Galkoff]] and [[Meadheaven]]

# Plot
While looking for into the disappearance of travelers between [[Galkoff]] and [[Meadheaven]], the party falls into the cave which is inhabited by Cultists of [[The Hand of the Sacred Flame]] (due to [[The Hand of the Sacred Flame#Cultist of the Cave in the Forrest|reasons]] this sect of cultists lacked the symbols associated with the cult). The party met Galkoff resident [[Roland Whitehorn]] and helped him escape the cave and defeat the leader of this band of Cultists.

## After [[Session 3]]
All evidence of the Cult being there was been removed from the cave, even the huge statue in the boss room has been moved.

# History
The cultists found the cave 2 months prior to the party arriving to the cave and started collecting sacrifices a month after.
