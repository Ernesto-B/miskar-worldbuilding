## Backstory
- Two years ago, a sudden and great thunderstorm started between Kaelyth and Dremscar islands. The winds and lightning were so violent that the passage between the two islands became impassable... waves as large as 20 meters and a mysterious force causing compasses to malfunction.
- Coincidentally, at the same time the storm started, a convoy of airships which was delivering the newly built Fortress [[Airship Image|Airships]] that were to be stationed at the other islands were traveling between the islands. They were obliterated and remains sunk to the bottom of the sea. 
- NPC: we don't know who or what caused the storm, but it must have been those barbaric pirates. They would have been completely eradicated if those Fortress Airships were deployed like the Council had planned. Even now (two years later), the Great Storm still rages on. Rumor is, only a high level [[C Rank]](???) Sorcerer or above is able to conjure spells that affect weather like that...
- Recently, the Storm has gotten even worse... the Council is trying to keep it under wraps, but supposedly some high ranking Adventurers sailed to the Spine and were able to catch a glimpse of a massive whirlpool in the center of the storm. The only other Whirlpool in recorded history of that scale appeared when the calamity beast: [menacing name] was awakened and ripped apart the country to form the [[Aetheris Isles]] from what once was the largest single island in the world.
- The Council has gotten restless. They are desperate to find the cause of the storm, and end it. Shortly after the sighting of the Whirlpool, they incentivized adventurers not just from the Isles but even beyond the [[Black Tides]] to go investigate and, if necessary, kill the mage behind it (this is why the party has arrived in the Isles).
- The reward for achieving this is 2,000 GP (mix of coin and item value).

## Why Party is There
- Some party members incentivized by monetary value, others incentivized by prestige, etc. But they are all there to be the adventurers that end the Great Storm.

## Main Adventures
- [[Great Storm Adventure]]
- [[Inherited Pursuit Adventure]]
- Push back the hoard the [[Underground Labyrinth]] ([[Labyrinth Related Adventure]]) - since all the high ranking adventurers are out trying to find and fight the cause of the Great Storm, only the weaker or untested adventurers are left to hold back the imminent dungeon break????

## Final Boss
- In the end, a young blue dragon (MM p50) given the name of Thunder Fang (not a named dragon since they get names when they reach adulthood) was behind the storm since he had made the area his lair. Previous adventuring parties had successfully found the beast but none came back alive, thus nobody knowing of its existence. 
- Due to having fought strong adventuring parties since the [[Council of Three]] made their statement and began bringing in parties from beyond the [[Black Tides]], the dragon has still-healing gashes and punctures from previous wounds. This has made him furious, and even more dangerous. 
- Young Blue Dragons seek to establish themselves as forces to be feared. Many claim ancient ruins where they might find magical paths to power. This blue dragon has cooperated with a powerful villain who had promised him followers and influence in the Isles. 

## Possible Connections to Next Arc
- Dragon was slayed and the party left victorious. However, this was part of the plan for the powerful villain... he needed the dragon to die in order to resurrect him as a dracolich (MM p101) and join his army in exchange for an opportunity for revenge. MAKE SURE there was a unique, specific death blow to the dragon, so when it comes back as a dracolich it is immediately recognizable.
