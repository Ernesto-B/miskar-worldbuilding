# Appearance & Personality
- Wood Elf, (lots of dex)
	- Voice - top voice, sad, pathetic
	- Personality - a push over, no self confidence

# Character Details
- Always with the wrong crowd
- Will always escape from the party only to be found in the next encounter
- Very Cowardly
- Has a habit to ramble on (Think Deku)

# Story Details
- Doesn’t know if hanging out with the party is better or worse than with the cult
- Was Given [[Shadow Runner|Shadow]]'s gear (+1 golden daggers and cloak) after defeating her
## Between [[Session 5]] and [[Session 10]]
- No one kept an eye on Shinji in [[Session 5]] so we wondered off trying to leave the town
	- Shinji has no heart to tell the party he was trying to leave them behind
- While trying to leave, he as spotted by [[Bloodgolds]] who thought that he was [[Shadow Runner]] since he was wearing her cloak and no one knows what she looks like.
- Shinji has since been at the tavern with the other partying [[Bloodgolds]] trying to escape but has been stopped by [[Dealer the Gambler|Dealer]] who obviously knew Shinji's true identity and thought that he'd catch [[Shag the Crazy|Shag]]'s killers and find out more about [[Shadow Runner|Shadow]]'s whereabouts
