Crumbs:
- When the PC's meet Vincent at the docks, Vincent scrunches his nose and says the party smells foul. He looks suspiciously at the party before getting cut off by Zorra.
- During an interaction with Zorra, Vincent emerges from below deck and sneers at the party... Zorra explains that he can smell ill-intent and that he has suspected the party since they first met. 
- Some crewmen begin to go missing inexplicably. 
- Crewman A witnesses Crewman B killing Crewman C and dumping him overboard at night. Crewman A tells the Captain, but the party and captain sees Crewman C on deck doing his duties. Crewman A's sanity/wellbeing is questioned. 
- Heavy scrape marks and splintered wood in the hold of the ship.
- Zorra tells the party that she suspects the captain... he has been acting strange this whole time, and he has forgotten has last name. 

Give the party: wand of wonder (PHB 322) from sea spawn fight & minor healing potion (if they save the captain). 


When dragged underwater:
- You have 1+CON mod rounds of breath 
- CON save (DC 10–15)
- On failure: lose 1 round of breath holding instantly.
- When out of breath, each round underwater gives one level of exhaustion.

If combat starts during long rest:
- Resting members are guaranteed surprised in combat and miss their first turn (they are belowdeck resting). Encourages someone to always be on lookout.

Lore drops:
- Zorra and Vincent have been trying to catch pirate captains (heads of the pirate organization) for months with no luck. They spent the rest of their gold on hiring a priest to cast `Speak with Dead` spell on one of the pirates the party killed in session 1 to get info on where one of the captains was located. No longer having gold, they could not afford to pay for escorts or mercenaries or an experienced crew. She is grateful for the party helping them. Thus even if Vincent suspects them, he has no choice but to leave you alone. Zorra trusts the party since they killed the pirates who attacked Westreach Port in session 1.
- Explain the **Weather Jewel**: a prized possession of the Isles that was obtained long ago, it was kept under utmost security by the Council of Three... the decision makers of the Isles.
- The Jewel is said to be able to change the weather at will to terrifying strength. Zorra heard from someone (her father) that the Jewel was somehow stolen by the pirates, and the pirate lord is using it to cause the Great Storm.
- **Stormhold's Labyrinth**:
