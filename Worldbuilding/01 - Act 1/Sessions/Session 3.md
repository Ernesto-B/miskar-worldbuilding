Crumbs:
- Some crewmen begin to go missing inexplicably. 
- Crewman A witnesses Crewman B killing Crewman C and dumping him overboard at night. Crewman A tells the Captain, but the party and captain sees Crewman C on deck doing his duties. Crewman A's sanity/wellbeing is questioned. 
- Heavy scrape marks and splintered wood in the hold of the ship.
- Zorra tells the party that she suspects the captain... he has been acting strange this whole time, and he has forgotten has last name. 

Give the party: wand of wonder (PHB 322) from sea spawn fight & minor healing potion (if they save the captain). 


When dragged underwater:
- You have 1+CON mod rounds of breath 
- CON save (DC 10–15)
- On failure: lose 1 round of breath holding instantly.
- When out of breath, each round underwater gives one level of exhaustion.
