Doppleganger fight where NPC comes in to help but instead its the enemy & PC's get attacked.

Soft launch the doppleganger before this fight: party has to decide who it is... doppleganger vs the original crewman? Sows uncertainty and mistrust among the crew. 

Pirate king stole a valuable item that everyone is after including the monsters as well as the Council?

The item that the pirate king has is source of the Great Storm (super strong power to control weather/environment). The Great Storm is a massive storm that is a concerning size and is only growing more. The public believe it was started by the Pirates since they have long since been plaguing the Archipelago, but it is in fact a young blue dragon that has made its lair in the region and is slowly recruiting armies/allies.

The pirates are the underlings of the Dragon. Dragon had tasked them with delivering the item to the dragon but the pirates decided that maybe they had a chance to beat the Dragon with the power of the item instead, so they kept it (or use it as a bargaining chip against the Council... the governing body of the Isles.)

Doppleganger is there to infiltrate and retrieve the item from the pirate king as a monster from a different affiliation (underdark perhaps) with other motives? Leads to introduction of another faction that is acting behind the scenes (possibly another arc in the future).
