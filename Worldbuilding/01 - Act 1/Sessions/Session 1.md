# Session Plan
- Start with: Immediate instability caused by the storm
> The airship’s descent is rougher than expected. Wind howls against the hull as the crew fights to keep altitude. Below you, Westreach Port looks tense — docks crowded, cranes half-idle, sails furled.
> As the gangplank lowers, a deep _boom_ rolls across the harbor. Not thunder — **something breaking**.
> Shouts erupt. A plume of smoke rises from the eastern docks. Bells begin to ring.

Arin - Caden 

Before you start (30 seconds to yourself):
- The party are new adventurers and outsiders.
- Tone is tense, unstable, political.
- The storm is pressure, not an enemy.
- Pirates are a visible threat, not the mastermind.
- Your goal is to force action immediately.

Opening frame – arrival under pressure (minutes 0–2):
- The party arrives by airship at Westreach Port.
- Weather is rough: strong winds, heavy clouds, distant thunder, rain beginning, slightly reduced visibility.
- The port feels stressed: overcrowded docks, delayed shipments, guards stretched thin, cranes operating hurriedly.
- Inciting disruption:
    - A loud crack or boom echoes from the docks.
    - Smoke rises from one section of the port.
    - Alarm bells begin ringing (not ceremonial).
- Do not ask “what do you do?” yet. Let them react instinctively.

Immediate chaos – what the players see (minutes 2–3):
- A small pirate skiff has rammed into the pier.
- Bandits dressed as pirates are active:
    - Some grabbing cargo.
    - One dragging a sailor hostage.
    - One firing a crossbow into the air or near civilians.
- Civilians:
    - Dockworkers scattering.
    - One trapped under a fallen crate.
- Guards:
    - Two or three guards fighting but clearly losing ground.
- Storm interaction:
    - Wind knocks over stacked crates.
    - Rain makes the wooden docks slick.
    - Mooring ropes swing loose.
- Introduce pressure by showing multiple problems at once. There is no obvious “correct” choice yet.

Transition to combat – when it ignites (around minute 3):
- Combat starts when:
    - A bandit actively threatens the hostage, or
    - A guard goes down, or
    - The players attack or intervene.
- Call for initiative only once violence is unavoidable.
- Emphasize that the pirates want speed and escape, not slaughter.

First encounter: pirate raid using bandits
Enemy setup (for you only):
- Four bandits actively fighting.
- One bandit attempting to escape with a small crate toward the skiff.
- One bandit holding a hostage and reacting to player actions.    
- Enemy mindset:
    - Objective is to grab cargo and escape.
    - They will flee if half their number is down, their leader is threatened, or their escape route is blocked.

Battlefield elements (use at least two):
- Crates:
    - Provide half cover.
    - Become difficult terrain if toppled.
- Mooring ropes:
    - Can be cut grabbed, or swung from.
- Crane arm:
    - Can drop cargo.
    - Can jam or collapse.
- Rising water:
    - Every two rounds, footing near the waterline becomes slick.
- Environmental reminder:
    - Wind affects ranged attacks narratively (mechanical penalties optional).

Secondary objectives (do not announce them, just show them):
- Stop the escaping bandit with cargo.
- Save the hostage.
- Protect dockworkers.
- Defeat or drive off the pirates.
- NPC pressure:
    - Dockworkers shout for help.
    - A guild representative yells to protect the cargo.
    - A guard captain shouts orders to cut the pirates off.
- No matter what the party prioritizes, someone will be unhappy.

Pirate behavior and morale:
- Bandits are not suicidal.
- At half health, when their leader is down, or when escape is blocked:
    - Pirates drop weapons.
    - Attempt to flee.
    - Beg or surrender.
- A good improvised line:
    - “Storm take this—this isn’t worth dying for!”
- If captured:
    - They are afraid and superstitious.
    - They hate the storm.
    - They do not know about the dragon.

Sky Guard Corps arrival (end of combat):
- They arrive after combat ends or pirates surrender, not during the fight.
- They secure prisoners, stabilize the area, and ask brief questions.
- They do not lavish praise.
- Tone is professional, guarded, and busy.

Aftermath – political seeding (minutes 8–10):
- Describe consequences:
    - Injured civilians.
    - Damaged cargo.
    - An angry guild representative.
    - Relieved dockworkers.
- First authority NPC:
    - A guild factor or inspector steps forward.
    - Focused on losses and logistics, not heroics.
- What they convey:
    - “You cost us less than it could’ve been.”
    - “That earns you a conversation.”
- Session hook:
    - Invitation to Stormhold.
    - “If you want real coin and real answers, we talk there.”

End on momentum:
- Do not resolve everything.
- Do not explain the storm.
- Do not reveal the dragon.
- End with:
    - Tension unresolved.
    - Opportunity offered.
    - The party’s reputation beginning to form.

### Guild vs Guards Argument
Purpose:
- Introduce faction tension
- Let players choose sides without committing fully

Situation:
- Guild representative argues with a guard captain:
    - Guild wants compensation and cargo protection
    - Guard wants pirates interrogated immediately
- Both turn to the party for support

Player choices:
- Support guild → money, future contracts
- Support guards → law, Sky Guard favor
- Stay neutral → reputation as independents

Key rule:
- No “right” answer
- No immediate punishment


### Interrogation Opportunity (Non-Combat)
Purpose:
- Seed doubt about pirates = storm cause
- Reward capture over killing

Situation:
- Players are allowed to observe or assist questioning a captured bandit.
- Pirate is scared, injured, superstitious.

What they can learn:
- Pirates hate the storm
- Raids have become riskier
- “Something in the storm scares even the old captains”
- No clear leader beyond local crews

Important:
- They do NOT learn about the dragon
- They DO learn the pirate narrative is incomplete

### Market Scene (Short and Focused)
Purpose:
- Let players breathe
- Show economic impact of storm
- Seed future locations

What players notice:
- Prices are higher
- Floatstone goods are guarded
- Vendors gossip nervously

Rumors you can drop (choose 2–3):
- “Stormhold’s Labyrinth broke again last week.”
- “Sky Guard lost a patrol near the Spine.”
- “Gale Sanctum festival might be canceled.”
- “Council’s hiding something — always are.”

General market atmosphere:
- Covered stalls lashed down with rope
- Canvas flaps snapping in the wind
- Guards posted near floatstone goods
- Merchants tense, watching the skies
- Prices up 10–20% compared to “normal times”

SHOP 1: SALTWIND OUTFITTERS  
Type: General adventuring gear
Run by:

- Treats adventurers like temporary tools, not heroes

Goods:
- Rope (50 ft)
- Grappling hook
- Torches
- Lantern + oil
- Crowbar
- Healer’s kit

Rumor line (optional):
- “Stormhold’s chewing through mercenaries faster than I can restock kits.”

SHOP 2: GULL & GAFF PROVISIONS  
Type: Food, rations, and morale
Run by:
- Young sibling pair
- Nervous but talkative
- Proud of surviving another bad season

Goods:
- Standard rations
- Dried fish and hardbread
- Spiced travel food (slightly better morale flavor)
- Cheap ale (local)
- Hot stew (if players linger)

Flavor:
- Food is simple but filling

- “Festival might be canceled. Bad sign if it is.”

End the market scene with:
- A messenger finding them
- A guild rep watching them from afar
- News spreading about the dock incident
