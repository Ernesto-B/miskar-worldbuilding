# Session Plan
- Start with: Immediate instability caused by the storm
> The airship’s descent is rougher than expected. Wind howls against the hull as the crew fights to keep altitude. Below you, Westreach Port looks tense — docks crowded, cranes half-idle, sails furled.
> As the gangplank lowers, a deep _boom_ rolls across the harbor. Not thunder — **something breaking**.
> Shouts erupt. A plume of smoke rises from the eastern docks. Bells begin to ring.
