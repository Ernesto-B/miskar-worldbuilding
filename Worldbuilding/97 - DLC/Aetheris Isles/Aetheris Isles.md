# Description
- The Aetheris Isles has 3 main islands, and the smaller islands are mostly all rocky and jagged, like slabs of sharp stone rising out of the water (uninhabitable). 
- Due to overhunting (fishing), the only monsters in the water are high level and danger rating, and thus travel by water is perilous. For this reason, the country is isolated from the mainland in the south where the rest of the countries are, and the only way to access the Isles is by navigating through the [[Black Tides]] and reaching [[Westreach Port]]. From there, travelers can sail to [[Vorynth Island]].
- To circumvent the issue of dangerous waters, the Isles has developed technology to travel by air using [[Airship Image|airships]] only affordable by the high class, rich adventurers, or wealthy merchants.
- All normal travel between the islands is done through wooden ships, and requires the employment of adventurers/mercenaries to defend the boat attacking monsters attracted to [[floatstone]]: the valuable material used to create airships, as well as for creating sky-farms.
- Another result of being relatively isolated from the rest of the world is that the peoples living in the archipelago cannot use magic (since ==magic was developed in the south)==. 
- Top scholars have devised a way to use purified floatstone placed on [[Floatstone Towers]] on each main island to create the [[Ascension Zone]]. In olden times, since there was little to no land usable for farming and animal grazing on the large islands, miners and farmers dug up and transported all the farmable dirt and plants from the smaller islands back to the large islands to be compacted and infused with large amounts of floatstone to ascend. As a result, any small islands that had soil were left barren and desolate.
- Due to floatstones only floating within the [[Ascension Zone]] created by the [[Floatstone Towers]], this technology is unable to leave or be used outside of the country, and the method to purify the floatstone is closely guarded by the [[Temple Guardians]].
- This has served to create a sense of strained acceptance by other countries, since going to war and attacking the archipelago would require first traveling on the immensely dangerous [[Black Tides]] filled with high class monsters, and then having to defend against attacks from the sky (Floating Bastions, [[Sky Guard Corps]]) and the sea. On the other hand, since the Aetheris Isles are behind in land-based technology, as well as cannot use magic, they lose their advantage in the southern continent and would become easy prey. Therefore, forced political pacts have been made between the Isles and neighboring nations ([[Kingdom of Drakonia|Drakonia]] and [[Grand Republic of Silveid|Silveid]]) that assure each other that nobody will expand borders or interfere with one another (forced stalemate).
- The archipelago worships the [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/The Three Pillars|Three Pillars]].

# Geographical Location and Features
* Northernmost country (as of the Undead Peace arc).
- 3 main islands: 
	- [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Kaelyth Island|Kaelyth]], [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Vorynth Island|Vorynth]], [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Dremscar Island|Dremscar]]
- 3 main cities; one on each main island: 
	- On Kaelyth Island: **Aeryndor** (center of airship technology and scholarly pursuits)
	- On Dremscar Island: **Skystead** (the capital of Aetheris Isles, seat of governance and home to the fiercest winds. Landscape scared by strong winds)
	- On Vorynth Island: [[Stormhold]] (a fortress-like city with a history of “dungeon breaks” from an [[Underground Labyrinth]])
- The [[Floatstone Towers]], and its [[Ascension Zone]].
- Ruins of the [[Falling Star Tower]] (see [[The War of Falling Stars]]). The ruins of the destroyed tower, located on the Northernmost island in the Isles, are said to hold secrets that could revolutionize floatstone technology—or doom the Isles. Adventurers occasionally venture there, lured by tales of treasure and forbidden knowledge.
* Floating Wildlife: Over the centuries, birds and small creatures have adapted to life near the sky farms, creating ecosystems in the floating fields. Sky farmers must contend with both pests and beneficial creatures.
* Ascendant Beasts: The Isles have domesticated large, winged creatures (e.g., sky wyverns or giant birds) to transport goods and people to the farms and defenses. This adds a bond between the people and their beasts while presenting a challenge for adventurers seeking to tame their own. 
* Floatstone Capsules: Capsules made from hollowed floatstone crystals that levitate within the field. Controlled by rudimentary pulleys or weights, they’re efficient but only fit a couple people or small trade carts.

# Lore


# Other Key Locations (not in cities)
- The Pillar's Spine
- The Blue Hole
- The Shattered Deep Maelstrom
- Pirate coves/bases
- Dungeons (3: South of the Spine, Center Spine, NE of Dremscar Island)

# History
- The Monster Purge: A centuries-old effort to eradicate weaker sea monsters led to the current predicament. Over time, only the most dangerous and adaptable creatures survived, evolving into even deadlier threats.
- Ancient Shipwrecks: The waters around the archipelago are littered with shipwrecks and remnants of failed invasions, many of which have become home to powerful aquatic monsters or contain forgotten treasures.
- The War of Falling Stars: A conflict between the archipelago and a southern empire over floatstone control nearly destroyed the archipelago's technology. During the war, an experimental floatstone tower being built was destroyed, causing a floating town to plummet into the sea. The ruins of this tower remain, shrouded in mystery.

# Detailed Notes

### Government Structure
* The Aetheris Isles are ruled by a [[Council of Three]], with each member representing one of the main islands: [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Kaelyth Island|Kaelyth]], [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Vorynth Island|Vorynth]], and [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Dremscar Island|Dremscar]]. The council operates as a cooperative oligarchy, with decisions made through debate and majority vote. Each councilor oversees the governance of their respective island, including economic policies, guild oversight, and defense coordination.
* Beneath the council, a network of guild representatives holds significant influence, as the guilds control much of the Isles' economy and technological advancements. These representatives advise the council on specialized matters, such as sky farming, airship technology, and tower maintenance.
* The council's authority is balanced by the [[Temple Guardians]]. A small religious order devoted to the Three Pillars. While they hold no formal political power, their spiritual influence ensures the council remains aligned with the Isles' traditions and values.
* The Aetheris Isles' political structure values cooperation and balance, mirroring the harmony maintained between the islands, the [[Ascension Zone]], and their survival amidst the perilous seas.

### Guilds
* The [[Ascendant Guild]]
* [[Adventurer's Guild]]
* [[Airship Guild]]

### Social/Economic/Political Hierarchy (Class Structure)
* Monster Contracts: The adventurer’s guilds play a vital role in the economy. High-paying contracts for monster-hunting provide a rare opportunity for lower-class individuals to ascend the social ladder.
* Highborns: Wealthy aristocrats owning vast sky-farms and airships.
* Mid-Tier Merchants: Traders and artisans who connect the islands with their goods and trade.
* Adventurers: Mercenaries and explorers, often hired for protection.
* Lowborns: Laborers, miners, and farmers struggling to rise in society.

### Political/Social Ideology and Culture
* Stormhold Martial Festival: A martial festival in the city of Stormhold (on [[Vorynth Island]]) featuring combat tournaments, honoring the island’s warrior tradition.
* Triune Harmony Festival: Celebrated when the Sea, Sky, and Stone Pillars are believed to align (symbolically or astrologically). Each city organizes a day of rituals, culminating in shared feasts and performances that bring the islands together. During the festival, the [[Floatstone Towers]] are adorned with lights and banners representing [[The Three Pillars]]. Special prayers are conducted to honor their unity.

### Trade and Economics
* Cultural Exports: Despite their relative isolation, the archipelago is famous for exporting advanced navigation instruments, floatstone-powered curiosities, and rare sky-farmed spices and fruits.
* While isolated, the Aetheris Isles export floatstone tools, rare sky-farmed spices, and exotic creatures. In return, they import necessities like foods and textiles.
* Airship captains and merchants are highly respected and wield significant influence.

### Language and Naming
- They speak a dialect of Iyresan, spoken in the [[Coast of Iyresa]].

### Religion
* Worship of [[The Three Pillars]].
* Are accepting of other religions, but do not tolerate disrespect to The Three Pillars.

### Magic
* Not usable since they have never had knowledge of it or someone capable of teaching it.
* Due to extremely low immigration from southern countries, magic users are rare and highly sought after by scholars and high class adventurers.
* Citizens have a sense of fear and wonder towards magic.

### Legal System


### Organized Crime
* Floatstone Smuggling: Despite the rulers' tight control, smuggling rings seek to export floatstone purification methods to southern nations, creating black markets and espionage opportunities.
* Sky Pirate Coalition: Pirates unite under a charismatic leader, targeting key airship routes. The adventurers are tasked with infiltrating the coalition to dismantle it from within.

### Education


### Inter-racial relations


### Music/Fashion/Food


### Science, Medicine, and Technology
* Sky Farms: Sky farms are marvels of ingenuity, with floating gardens irrigated by rain collected and funneled through channels. They are carefully maintained, as damage to the floatstone field would cause catastrophic collapse.

### Military, Secret Services, Conflict
* Tensions with the South: Southern countries have spies within the archipelago, hoping to discover its technological secrets, as well as safe sea-routes to reach the islands in the event of an invasion. Meanwhile, the archipelago employs agents to sabotage southern expansion, and obtain knowledge about magic and technology.
* [[Ascendant Wardens]]
* [[Sky Guard Corps]]
* Floating Bastions: Drifting defensive blimps encircle the towers and cities, outfitted with ballistae and small cannons. They are manned by guards and equipped with emergency evacuation systems using floatstone parachutes.
* Jagged reefs and rocks around Dremscar have been reinforced with hidden spikes and floating buoys that release explosive charges when tampered with.
* Guarded ports feature underwater cages made of floatstone-laced steel to deter sea monsters. Due to the astronomical value of floatstone, this method is not used to make sea-routes between islands.

### The Supernatural/Myths/Legends
* Creation Myth: The Three Pillars were said to be celestial siblings who descended to the mortal realm to create the Aetheris Isles as a haven for humanity. Their cooperation shaped the sea, the sky, and the land.
* Pillar Disputes: Stories tell of times when the Pillars quarreled, resulting in natural disasters like storms, earthquakes, and droughts. These tales are used to teach the importance of unity and balance.
* ==The Leviathan Pact==: Legends claim that the most intelligent sea monsters formed a pact with the early rulers of the Aetheris Isles. The monsters allowed the archipelago to thrive, but the pact was broken during the Monster Purge.
* Echoes of the Ancients: On quiet nights, some claim to hear whispers emanating from the towers. Theories range from trapped souls of their creators to residual energy from the Three Pillars communicating with the faithful.

### Architecture/Civic Planning
* South European style architecture and interconnectedness. Very few roads and lots of verticality.

### Aging & Pregnancy
