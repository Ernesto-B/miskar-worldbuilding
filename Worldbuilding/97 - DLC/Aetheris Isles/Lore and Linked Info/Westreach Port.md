# Description
- The only entry point to the [[00 - Aetheris Isles|Aetheris Isles]] from the Southern Continent. To get there, travelers must first take the safe passage through the [[Black Tides]].
- Since entry into the Isles is more regulated than entrance into Westreach Port (due to fear of espionage and sabotage), the majority of merchants sell their wares here. As such, Westreach Port is home to one of the largest markets in the Isles (second to the market in Stormhold on [[Vorynth Island]]).
- As a result of the more lax entry and large concentration of trade goods, Westreach Port is a frequent target of pirates and burglar groups.
- Tavern rumors often swirl about pirate ships daring the Black Tides or hidden treasures washed ashore by storms.
- Special permission is required to live in Westreach Port.

# Location
- North of the Southern Continent, past the [[Black Tides]].
- West of [[Vorynth Island]].
