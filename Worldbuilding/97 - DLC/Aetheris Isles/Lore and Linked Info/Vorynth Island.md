# Description
![[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/attachments/Pasted image 20250110150738.png]]
* Vorynth Island is the southeastern sentinel of the [[00 - Aetheris Isles|Aetheris Isles]], standing as a rugged, defiant land shaped by storms, turbulent seas, and a martial culture. Its jagged coastline and rough terrain have forged a population known for their resilience, discipline, and strength. The island's proximity to the [[Black Tides]] makes it both a strategic stronghold and a dangerous frontier.
* It is a land of dense forests and rolling hills. Its northern regions are slightly more temperate, while the southern coast faces relentless winds and storms blowing in from the [[Black Tides]].


# Location
- South-Eastern most island of the [[00 - Aetheris Isles|Aetheris Isles]]. 
- It is surrounded by the [[Black Tides]] sea to its south, and is the only main island accessible from [[Westreach Port]].

# Plot


# Key Locations
* [[Stormhold]]: A fortress-like city, home of the [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Underground Labyrinth]].
* [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/The Three Pillars#The Sea Pillar|Sea Pillar]] Temple, the "Keeper of Depths". 
* [[Gale Sanctum]], the location where the Stormhold Martial Festival occurs. 
* South Port: the only safe access from [[Westreach Port]] to the archipelago, and from the archipelago to the outside world.
* North Port: A quieter port catering to travelers making their way to [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Dremscar Island]] through The Pillar’s Spine. It serves as a waypoint for adventurers and scholars, offering fewer luxuries but plenty of stories about the Spine’s dangers.

# History
- The Labyrinth's Curse: It is said that the [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Underground Labyrinth]] was once a [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/floatstone]] mine abandoned after the collapse of a major section. Many believe the mine was cursed by the [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/The Three Pillars#The Sea Pillar|Sea Pillar]] due to greed, causing it to spawn the monsters that now roam its depths.
- The Black Tides Legend: Vorynth sailors tell tales of a ghostly ship that appears during the worst storms, its crew cursed to wander the [[Black Tides]] forever. Sightings are considered both a warning and a blessing, as survivors often return with tales of hidden treasures.
