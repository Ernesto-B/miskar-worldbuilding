# Lore
The Three Pillars represent the foundation of life in the [[00 - Aetheris Isles|Aetheris Isles]]. Each Pillar is tied to an essential element of the Isles' survival—Sea, Sky, and Stone—and is worshipped through distinct practices and rituals. Each island in the archipelago has a temple to one of these deities, emphasizing their respective contributions to survival:
- On [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Kaelyth Island]]: Sky Pillar, the "Bringer of Winds"
- On [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Vorynth Island]]: Sea Pillar, the "Keeper of Depths"
- On [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Dremscar Island]]: Stone Pillar, the "Eternal Foundation"

### The Sky Pillar - Kaelyth Island
* The Sky Pillar embodies freedom, innovation, and protection. It is believed to guide the winds, crucial for airships, gliders, and crop growth on sky farms.
* Symbol: A spiral of winds encircling a radiant sun.
* **Temple of Winds**: Located on Kaelyth Island, this temple stands atop the island's natural highest point. Its architecture includes spires designed to catch and amplify the wind’s song, creating a melodic hum throughout the temple. Floatstone sculptures of birds and clouds decorate the temple, and wind chimes hang from every corner.
* Skyward Blessing: Sky farmers, airship pilots, and the Sky Guard undergo a blessing ritual before their journeys. They light incense that creates colorful smoke trails, symbolizing the winds’ guidance.
* Call of the Winds: At dawn, worshippers gather to release small, floatstone-powered kites carrying prayers and wishes into the skies.

### The Sea Pillar
* The Sea Pillar governs the oceans surrounding the Isles, symbolizing the mysteries of the deep, adaptability, and resilience. It is seen as a dual force: a provider (offering fish and trade routes) and a destroyer (unleashing deadly monsters and storms).
* Symbol: A spiraling wave encircling a single eye, representing the all-seeing depths.
* **Temple of the Depths**: Located on [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Vorynth Island]], the temple is built partially underwater. Its main chamber is a vast, dome-like structure with glass panels offering views of the ocean depths.
- Visitors offer shells, salt, and miniature floatstone carvings to honor the sea’s bounty and protection.
- Drowning of Fears: Participants write their fears or sins on palm leaves and release them into the water during ceremonies. If the offering is accepted (it sinks quickly), the Sea Pillar has forgiven them.
- Storm's Trial: An annual event where aspiring sailors or adventurers brave a treacherous stretch of sea to prove their worth to the Keeper of Depths.

### The Stone Pillar - Skystead
* The Stone Pillar represents stability, endurance, and knowledge. It is the protector of the floatstone fields and the physical and spiritual foundation of the Isles.
- Symbol: A triangular mountain split in the center, revealing a glowing crystal core.
- **Temple of the Foundation**: Located in Skystead on Dremscar Island, the temple is a monumental structure carved into the island’s cliffs. Its central chamber holds a massive chunk of unpurified floatstone, believed to be a fragment of the Pillar itself. The temple features intricate carvings detailing the history of the Aetheris Isles, passed down through generations.
- Stonekeeper’s Vigil: Worshippers meditate in silence within the temple, touching the sacred floatstone. It is said to grant visions or insights into the future.
- The Unyielding March: Islanders carry heavy stones up the cliffs to the temple as an act of penance or devotion, symbolizing their willingness to endure hardship.
- Foundation’s Renewal: Once a year, a ceremonial purification of floatstone occurs at the temple. The process is kept secret, and only the most trusted scholars and clergy are allowed to participate.
