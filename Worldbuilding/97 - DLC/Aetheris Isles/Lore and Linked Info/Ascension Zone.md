# Lore
* The area encircled by the [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Floatstone Towers]] in the [[00 - Aetheris Isles|Aetheris Isles]].
* Within the Ascension Zone, unpurified [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/floatstone]] rises naturally, creating a safe haven for sky farms, floating bastions, and airship docks. The field is self-regulating but requires periodic recalibration by skilled engineers and scholars.
