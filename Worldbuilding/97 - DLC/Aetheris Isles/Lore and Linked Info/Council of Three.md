# Summary
- The Council of Three serves as the ruling body of the [[Aetheris Isles|Aetheris Isles]], with each councilor representing one of the main islands: [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Kaelyth Island|Kaelyth]], [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Vorynth Island|Vorynth]], and [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Dremscar Island|Dremscar]]. These leaders are chosen from the most respected figures in their respective regions, often drawn from influential guilds, military leaders, or prominent families. They act as both governors and representatives of their islands, overseeing local governance, resource management, and defense.
- Each councilor resides on their home island, ensuring they are closely connected to their people and aware of their island’s specific challenges.
- The council only convenes in **Skystead** when faced with grave issues that threaten the Isles as a whole, such as external invasions, major disruptions to the [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Ascension Zone|Ascension Zone]], or disputes that require unified resolution.
- In their absence, each councilor appoints trusted delegates to handle day-to-day administrative matters on their behalf.
- While their decisions often rely on cooperation and debate, tensions between the councilors are not uncommon, reflecting the differing priorities and values of their islands. These disputes are typically resolved through negotiation, though power plays and alliances between islands occasionally arise.
