# Lore
* An extremely valuable resource that is apparently only mined in the [[00 - Aetheris Isles|Aetheris Isles]], specifically in floatstone fields.
* As it is so coveted and there is a limited quantity mined, only Aetherists of middle class and higher can afford it. 
* In its raw form, it is extremely durable and light, and is mostly used in gear and tools. It is malleable, and so is not used to make weaponry. Inside the [[Worldbuilding/97 - DLC/Aetheris Isles/Lore and Linked Info/Ascension Zone]], items with sufficient floatstone in them will tend to float.
* Can be **purified** to make into pure floatstone. Pure floatstone will not float within the Ascension Zone, but rather can be used to expand it. As such, [[Kingdom of Drakonia|Drakonia]] and [[Grand Republic of Silveid|Silveid]] have banned the commercial purification of floatstone as part of political pacts. Pure floatstone is extremely hard and looks like normal steel. As such, many Aetherists of high social standing and renowned adventurers have a special interest in obtaining weaponry made of such material in black markets. 
* Only a select few people from the highest echelons of society know the purification process, and nobody knows how the knowledge is passed down or kept.
