# Description
- A small, predominantly [[Beastfolk]] settlement nestled along the western shore of the [[Iyresan Bay]]. The town thrives on its fishing industry, harvesting the Bay’s bountiful waters, and cultivating simple crops in its sparse fields. Known for its tight-knit community and rustic charm, Baytown serves as a peaceful respite for travelers and adventurers exploring the region. However, beneath its tranquil surface lies a town deeply connected to the Bay’s ancient history and haunted by the legacy of the sunken beastfolk city.

# Adventuring Hooks
- Baytown hosts seasonal fishing contests to celebrate the Bay’s bounty. While seemingly mundane, these events often include unexpected challenges such as sea monster attacks or rival saboteurs.
- **Rivalry with Humans:** A human noble from Cascadea or Stonefall sends a team to explore the Bay’s ruins, claiming ownership over the sunken city’s treasures. The townsfolk hire adventurers to protect their ancestral legacy.
- Some in the town whisper that Cascadea’s rise to prominence was built on treasures stolen from the sunken city, further fueling resentment toward the humans.
