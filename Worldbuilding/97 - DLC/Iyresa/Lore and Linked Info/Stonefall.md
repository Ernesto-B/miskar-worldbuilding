# Description
- Stonefall is a sprawling, vertical city in [[built within the massive crater left behind by the violent dislodging of the floating landmass that now holds Cascadea. The city exists in stark contrast to the grandeur of its aerial counterpart, thriving instead on the second-hand benefits of [[Cascadea]]’s trade and wealth. Its streets are alive with the sounds of haggling merchants, clanging forges, and whispered dealings, all while a shadow of disorganization and lawlessness looms over much of its populace.
- Stonefall is divided into five distinct sections, called [[Hollow|Hollows]], each carved into the crater's sheer walls and organized by elevation. These Hollows represent not only the physical layout of the city but also the socioeconomic hierarchy of its people. Each Hollow is separated by massive metal grates, reinforced with thick steel beams, and platform elevators, which serve as the primary means of vertical travel. While higher Hollows are more regulated and secure, the lower Hollows devolve into chaos and lawlessness, thus creating a survival-of-the-fittest mentality.
- Beastfolk in Stonefall: Beastfolk dominate physically demanding roles in the Ember Ring and Dimming Mire, such as laborers, guards, and miners. Their enhanced senses also make them excellent trackers, often hired by the [[Black Basin Syndicate]] for smuggling and enforcement. In the Black Depths, beastfolk fighters often hold dominance in the ==Pit of Despair==, their raw strength making them favorites in the brutal underground battles. However, they are often exploited by humans running the arena.
- Humans in Stonefall: Humans occupy roles requiring cunning and magical prowess, such as merchants, alchemists, and minor enchanters in the Azure Steps. The Sunlit Crown is predominantly human, as their affinity for magic and wealth accumulation secures them positions of influence in the Iyresan government.

# Location
- The city is formed on the natural ridges that were formed from the meteor impact.

# Key Locations
- **The Sunlit Crown (First [[Hollow]]):**
    - Perched at the top of the crater, the Sunlit Crown enjoys the rare blessing of full sunlight. This district is home to Stonefall’s wealthiest citizens, influential merchants, and members of the ==Council of Hollows==, who govern the city with varying degrees of corruption.
    - Streets are lined with well-maintained stone buildings adorned with ornate carvings and magical lanterns. Lavish markets sell high-quality goods imported from Cascadea, though they come at exorbitant prices.
    - Guard presence is strong, and only those with proper documentation or bribes can ascend to this Hollow.
- **The Azure Steps (Second [[Hollow]]):**
    - A bustling middle-class district, where skilled artisans, tradespeople, and merchants ply their crafts. This Hollow is named for the Azure Aqueducts, a network of enchanted water channels that wind through the streets, delivering fresh water to the upper Hollows.
    - The air is thick with the scent of forges, workshops, and food stalls, as residents work tirelessly to cater to the demands of the wealthier layers. While relatively safe, the Azure Steps still struggle with occasional thefts and disputes.
- **The Ember Ring (Third [[Hollow]]):**
    - The lifeblood of Stonefall, where laborers, miners, and adventurers reside. This district rings the crater like a glowing band, with forges and smelters constantly churning out tools, weapons, and armor for trade.
    - Despite its utility, the Ember Ring is rough and rowdy, with crime syndicates and mercenary gangs occasionally clashing in the streets. The Black Basin Syndicate exerts significant influence here, running a smuggling operation through secret tunnels and the lower platform elevators.
- **The Dimming Mire (Fourth [[Hollow]]):**
    - The first of the truly impoverished districts, where homes are little more than shanties stacked precariously against the crater’s walls. The dim, damp environment is illuminated only by bioluminescent fungi cultivated by desperate residents for both light and food.
    - The Dimming Mire is infamous for its Rot Bazaar, a sprawling black market where anything can be bought or sold—be it illegal goods, monster parts, or forbidden magic. The Syndicate maintains a dominant presence here, ensuring their operations thrive without interference.
    - Disease and despair are common, and most residents are either too poor to leave or unwilling to risk the dangers of moving to the Black Depths below.
- **The Black Depths (Fifth [[Hollow]]):**
    - The lowest and most dangerous part of Stonefall, where sunlight never reaches and the air is damp and stifling. The Black Depths are a chaotic sprawl of dilapidated structures, forgotten tunnels, and gang hideouts.
    - Here lies the Pit of Despair, an infamous underground fighting ring operated by the [[Black Basin Syndicate]]. Fighters from all Hollows come to prove their strength or die trying, while spectators gamble their last coins, and food scraps when no coin can be found.
    - Rumors persist of ancient ruins and dangerous monsters lurking in the deepest parts of the crater, though few who venture into these areas return to tell the tale.

### Adventuring Hooks
- Syndicate Secrets: The [[Black Basin Syndicate]] is rumored to control hidden tunnels connecting all five Hollows, using them for smuggling and covert operations. These tunnels are fiercely guarded, and adventurers who stumble upon them often disappear.
- The Collapsing Depths: Whispers circulate that the Black Depths are unstable, and a catastrophic collapse could threaten the entire city. The Iyresan government refuses to acknowledge the danger.
- The Forgotten Crater: Deep in the Black Depths, fragments of an ancient civilization’s ruins hint at Stonefall’s origins, but few have explored them due to the dangers lurking in the dark.
