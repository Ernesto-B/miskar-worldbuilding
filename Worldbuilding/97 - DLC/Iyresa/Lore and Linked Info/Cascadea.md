# Description
- Cascadea is the capital city in the [[Coast of Iyresa]] built atop a colossal floating landmass suspended 62,000 years ago for reasons lost to history. Known as the King of Entertainment and Luxury, it is the pinnacle of culture, commerce, and hedonism, accessible only to the world’s wealthiest, most influential merchants, adventurers, and scholars. Its architecture draws inspiration from East-Asian designs, with pagoda-style roofs, orange lanterns casting warm light, tatami mats, and arching wooden bridges spanning the shallow lake that covers the landmass. Navigation is done by walking on narrow, wooden streets or using East-Asian-style canoes to traverse the lake’s waterways.
- The city is divided into five [[Drift|Drifts]], each serving a distinct purpose and collectively maintaining the harmony and functionality of Cascadea. Water spills over the island’s edges through five waterfalls, flows inversely back up to the lake due to a mysterious central force, and drains through a medium-sized pit in the lake’s center called the ==Heartfall==, creating an endless cycle.

# Geographical Location and Features
- Cascadea is a floating island. The only way to enter the city is from the bottom of the island and utilizing special transport methods that take advantage of waterfalls that flow upwards.

# Lore


# Other Key Locations
- Cascadea’s five [[Drift]]s serve specific roles in the city’s daily life and economy, ensuring a harmonious coexistence of activities rather than class divisions. Each Drift contributes uniquely to the city’s reputation as the pinnacle of entertainment and culture:
	- **The Golden Drift** (Commerce and Trade): The city’s bustling marketplace and trade hub, where high-end goods, luxury items, and rare magical artifacts are bought and sold. Includes the **Celestial Auction Hall**, where the wealthiest merchants and adventurers bid on treasures from across the world.
	- **The Velvet Drift** (Pleasure and Entertainment): Renowned for its theaters, bathhouses, gambling halls, and tea houses. The Velvet Drift is the beating heart of Cascadea’s fame as a city of pleasure. Features the **Grand Pavilion**, an enormous open-air theater hosting magical performances, concerts, and plays.
	- **The Silver Drift** (Governance and Administration): Houses Cascadea’s government buildings, including the **Council Chambers**, where the city’s court deliberates and makes decisions. Includes embassies for other nations, as Cascadea serves as a neutral ground for diplomacy. Administrative offices oversee taxation, infrastructure, and the maintenance of the water cycle system.
	- **The Spirit Drift** (Culture and Religion): Dedicated to preserving Cascadea’s cultural and spiritual identity, the Azure Drift is home to grand libraries, galleries, and the **Temple of the Flowing Cycle**, which honors the mysterious force that powers the floating landmass. Scholars and historians work tirelessly here to study the glyphs and ruins scattered across the landmass.
	- **The Flowing Drift** (Logistics and Infrastructure): Serves as the backbone of Cascadea’s functionality, managing waste disposal, water flow, and supplies. Includes the **Waterspire Foundry**, where enchanted tools and materials are crafted to maintain the city’s systems. While not glamorous, the Obsidian Drift is essential to the city’s survival, and its workers are respected for their vital contributions.
- The division of Drifts by purpose rather than social class fosters a sense of equality among Cascadea’s residents. Whether one works in governance, trade, or entertainment, all contribute to the city’s prosperity and share in its luxuries. This cultural unity is a source of pride for Cascadeans, setting their city apart from the stratified society of Stonefall.

* Beastfolk, with their enhanced physical abilities and senses, excel in entertainment, security, and logistics. While accepted in Cascadea, they rarely reach the highest levels of influence due to their limited magical aptitude.

### Organized Crime
* The [[Black Basin Syndicate]]: The Syndicate smuggles contraband into Cascadea, including rare magical artifacts, forbidden enchantments, and illegal substances. They use secret routes through the Flowing Drift to bypass inspections and exploit the water cycle for transportation. The Velvet Drift is a hotspot for their influence, where they manage high-stakes gambling, blackmail operations, and recruitment through entertainment venues.
* Council Corruption: Corrupt council members secretly collaborate with the Syndicate to consolidate power or eliminate rivals. They hire skilled adventurers, entertainers, and escorts to seduce, blackmail, or assassinate opponents, ensuring plausible deniability and leaving little evidence behind. These plots often involve elaborate setups, such as framing a rival for embezzlement or orchestrating a public scandal. Their operations in Cascadea are clean, quiet, and calculated. They avoid brute force, relying instead on manipulation, espionage, and social engineering.

### Military, Secret Services, Conflict
* Most of Cascadea’s conflicts occur behind closed doors, involving political schemes, blackmail, and covert assassinations.
* Pirates and rival nations occasionally target Cascadea’s trade routes, though they rarely succeed due to the fact that sailing through the [[Black Tides]] requires adventurers to escort the ships. Since there is no telling how strong the adventurers will be, it is risky for pirates to act and expose themselves on the sea. 
* Land routes are more susceptible to being plundered due to being less dangerous than travel by the [[Black Tides]], but lucrative or worried merchants and traders will often hire adventurers as guards.
* Due to the relatively small size of the country, as well as the fact there they are politically neutral, there is little worry of international conflict or tensions rising. 
* While relations between humans and beastfolk are better in Cascadea than in Stonefall, some beastfolk feel they are still treated unfairly, leading to small but growing protests.

### The Supernatural/Myths/Legends
* The city’s unique water system is both a wonder and a mystery: The pit at the lake's center, called the **Heartfall**, is believed to be tied to the landmass’s suspension. Scholars theorize that the water cycle is maintained by a combination of ancient magic and an unseen magnetic or gravitational force.
- The **Inverse Falls**, where water flows upward to Cascadea, are a global marvel. Many believe these waterfalls are sacred, symbolizing the cycle of life and renewal.

### Architecture/Civic Planning
* East-Asian designs, with pagoda-style roofs, orange lanterns casting warm light, tatami mats, and arching wooden bridges spanning the shallow lake that covers the landmass. Navigation is done by walking on narrow, wooden streets or using East-Asian-style canoes to traverse the lake’s waterways.
