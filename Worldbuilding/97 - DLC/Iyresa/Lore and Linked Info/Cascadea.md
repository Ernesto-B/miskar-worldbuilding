# Description
- Cascadea - a floating island - is the upper city in the country of [[Coast of Iyresa|Iyresa]].
- The city is surrounded by a magnetic field that came to be after a meteor struck the land. The magnetic field has benefitted the city in 2 ways: It wards off monsters, as well as allows individuals to travel up and down the island's inverse waterfalls.
- 

# Geographical Location and Features
- Cascadea is a floating island. The only way to enter the city is from the bottom of the island and utilizing special transport methods that take advantage of waterfalls that flow upwards.
- There are 5 inverse waterfalls that are affected by Cascadea's magentic field, dividing the city into 5 [[Drift|Drifts]], each serving a different purpose.

# Other Key Locations
- **Echoeside** (First [[Drift]]):**

- **The Azure Steps (Second [[Drift]]):**
    - A bustling middle-class district, where skilled artisans, tradespeople, and merchants ply their crafts. This Hollow is named for the Azure Aqueducts, a network of enchanted water channels that wind through the streets, delivering fresh water to the upper Hollows.
    - The air is thick with the scent of forges, workshops, and food stalls, as residents work tirelessly to cater to the demands of the wealthier layers. While relatively safe, the Azure Steps still struggle with occasional thefts and disputes.
- **The Ember Ring (Third [[Drift]]):**
    - The lifeblood of Stonefall, where laborers, miners, and adventurers reside. This district rings the crater like a glowing band, with forges and smelters constantly churning out tools, weapons, and armor for trade.
    - Despite its utility, the Ember Ring is rough and rowdy, with crime syndicates and mercenary gangs occasionally clashing in the streets. The [[Black Basin Syndicate]] exerts significant influence here, running a smuggling operation through secret tunnels and the lower platform elevators.
- **The Dimming Mire (Fourth [[Drift]]):**
    - The first of the truly impoverished districts, where homes are little more than shanties stacked precariously against the crater’s walls. The dim, damp environment is illuminated only by bioluminescent fungi cultivated by desperate residents for both light and food.
    - The Dimming Mire is infamous for its Rot Bazaar, a sprawling black market where anything can be bought or sold—be it illegal goods, monster and human parts, or forbidden magic. The Syndicate maintains a dominant presence here, ensuring their operations thrive without interference.
    - Disease and despair are common, and most residents are either too poor to leave or unwilling to risk the dangers of moving to the Black Depths below.
- **The Black Depths (Fifth [[Drift]]):**
    - The lowest and most dangerous part of Stonefall, where sunlight never reaches and the air is damp and stifling. The Black Depths are a chaotic sprawl of dilapidated structures, forgotten tunnels, and gang hideouts.
    - Here lies the Pit of Despair, an infamous underground fighting ring operated by the [[Black Basin Syndicate]]. Fighters from all Hollows come to prove their strength or die trying, while spectators gamble their last coins, and food scraps when no coin can be found.
    - Rumors persist of ancient ruins and dangerous monsters lurking in the deepest parts of the crater, though few who venture into these areas return to tell the tale.
