# Description
- The Iyresan Bay in the is a stunning expanse of shallow, clear waters located in the [[Coast of Iyresa]]. Known for its tranquil beauty and rich underwater life, the Bay is a vital source of sustenance and lore for the surrounding region. However, the ruins of an ancient city and shipwrecks hidden in its waters hint at a more complex history.
- Villages and settlements bordering the Bay like [[Baytown]] are able to fish regularly to sustain their food stores. 
- The Bay’s consistently shallow waters make it easy to wade through, with fish and coral visible beneath the surface. However, the presence of shipwrecks scattered across the Bay raises questions about its history, as it suggests the waters were once deep enough to support larger vessels.

# Key Locations
- **Island Shrine**: A small island sits on the Bay’s southeast edge, holding a shrine of East-Asian design. The shrine, a tiered pagoda surrounded by stone lanterns, is well-preserved despite its age.
- **The Vertical Wall**: The Bay’s northern edge meets a sheer rock face that leads directly to the Iyresan Plains above. Small, treacherous pathways carved into the rock are used by those daring enough to ascend or descend between the two regions.
- **Sunken City**: The sunken city was once a stronghold of beastfolk who ruled the region. Human invaders sought to claim it for its strategic location, and after years of war, the humans unleashed a devastating magical weapon to destroy the city, sinking it into the sea. The magic used in the war fractured the sea floor, causing the ground beneath the city to collapse. The resulting currents formed the bay’s unique shallow waters.

# Adventuring Hooks
- The island shrine’s caretakers claim it has been defiled by thieves or corrupted by a dark force. Adventurers are tasked with cleansing or restoring the shrine, which may involve combat, puzzles, or uncovering its origins.
- The sunken city’s architecture and artifacts reflect the advanced civilization of the beastfolk, emphasizing their connection to nature and the sea, but also their understanding and use of magic. Statues of beastfolk deities and elaborate carvings tell stories of their reign.
