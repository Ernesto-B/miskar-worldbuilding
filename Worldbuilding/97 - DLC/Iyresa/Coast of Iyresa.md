# History




# Detailed Notes
### Government Structure
* The coast is a democratically run nation with a chair made up of 10 people. Of the 10, 5 come from [[Cascadea]], where each candidate is from a different [[Drift]], and 5 from [[Stonefall]], where each candidate is from a separate [[Hollow]].
* Due of the diversity of the chair, internal conflict arises because of opposing interests and goals.
* Internal conflicts leads to negligence in both cities, which results in crime lords arising in the lower [[Hollow|Hollows]]

### Organized Crime
* Organized crime has risen in the lower [[Hollow|Hollows]], such as smuggling, kidnapping, drug dealing, thievery, illegal use of magical items, and manslaughter.
* The organized crime has arisen due to tensions in the government chair, where even though [[Stonefall]] has 5 representatives, no real changes are being made to make the quality of life better. Crime lords are resorting to these crimes so that they can make a living as well as protect their peers from other crime lords.
* [[Cascadea]] is absent of crime on paper, however, many citizens strike deals with crime lords from [[Stonefall]] to obtain illegal substances or other dangerous items.
* The upper class of humans in [[Cascadea]], though rare, use illegal illusion magic to deceive traders or customers for personal gain. Some of these scholars of magic have made their way up into a government chair.
