# History
- Iyresa was originally home to the [[Beast People]], who inhabited every inch of land east of the [[Cindral Mountains]].
- 62,000 years ago, a meteor hit the northern part of the land, sending the [[Beast People]] southeast towards the forest.
- The meteor blast shot out [[floatstone]] which landed in the [[Aetheris Isles]], alerting the inhabiting humans of the the power the stone had. As a result of the new discovery and power of the stone, the humans ventured down across [[Black Tides]] to see the aftermath of the blast to see if the could salvage even more magical materials. 
- ==Upon arrival, humans imitated powers from the stone and learned/evolved their own magic. Some people from the [[Aetheris Isles]] saw these new magical phenomena as blasphemous as it went against their religion, and others wanted to keep exploring these abilities and make it apart of their day-to-day lives; hence, this created a new population of humans in the north of the continent, whereas the non-believers travelled back to the isles.==
- Eventually, the [[Beast People]] returned to rebuild civilization but were faced with foreign humans from the [[Aetheris Isles]], resulting in tensions which led to a territorial dispute. 
- This dispute was violent, as the [[Beast People]] were abundant in number. However, the humans had managed to hone their magical abilities enough to be able to fend off a large amount of opponents with both defensive and offensive spellcasting.
- A shrine was built southeast of the crater on an island. This shrine was meant for [[Beast People]] to come and pray when their loved ones were out fighting. 
- The humans, knowing they were outnumbered, and the [[Beast People]], knowing they could not match the humans' offensive powers, eventually decided to call a ceasefire. This ceasefire lasted for a year before coming back together and declaring a truce, where both beings could co-exist. 
- To this day, the truce remains and the beings co-exist peacefully with each other. 


# Detailed Notes
### Government Structure
* The coast is a democratically run nation with a chair made up of 10 people. Of the 10, 5 come from [[Cascadea]], where each candidate is from a different [[Drift]], and 5 from [[Stonefall]], where each candidate is from a separate [[Hollow]].
* Due of the diversity of the chair, internal conflict arises because of opposing interests and goals.
* Internal conflicts leads to negligence in both cities, which results in crime lords arising in the lower [[Hollow|Hollows]]

### Organized Crime
* Organized crime has risen in the lower [[Hollow|Hollows]], such as smuggling, kidnapping, drug dealing, thievery, illegal use of magical items, and manslaughter.
* The organized crime has arisen due to tensions in the government chair, where even though [[Stonefall]] has 5 representatives, no real changes are being made to make the quality of life better. Crime lords are resorting to these crimes so that they can make a living as well as protect their peers from other crime lords.
* [[Cascadea]] is absent of crime on paper, however, many citizens strike deals with crime lords from [[Stonefall]] to obtain illegal substances or other dangerous items.
* The upper class of humans in [[Cascadea]], though rare, use illegal illusion magic to deceive traders or customers for personal gain. Some of these scholars of magic have made their way up into a government chair.
