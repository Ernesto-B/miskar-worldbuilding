# Description
- The Coast of Iyresa is split into 2 major parts: the upper city, known as [[Cascadea]], and the lower city, known as [[Stonefall]]. 
- To enter the country, there are pathways coming from the mountains in the southwest, as well as sea ports for ships coming in from the northeast.
- Between the main cities and the mountains, Iyresa is made up of abundant plains which are home to medium-skilled monsters.
- To the west are numerous caves which are host to both precious ores and ferocious beasts that are no easy feat. 
- The Coast is a central hub which is host to many festivals and markets where lots of trading occurs.

# Detailed Notes
### Government Structure
* The coast is a democratically run nation with a chair made up of 10 people. Of the 10, 5 come from [[Cascadea]], where each candidate is from a different [[Drift]], and 5 from [[Stonefall]], where each candidate is from a separate [[Hollow]].
* Due of the diversity of the chair, internal conflict arises because of opposing interests and goals.
* Internal conflicts leads to negligence in both cities, which results in crime lords arising in the lower [[Hollow|Hollows]]
