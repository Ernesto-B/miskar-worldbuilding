- This world will react to your actions or inactions. NPCs, enemies, and creatures will act while you play. The world will not sit still for the party. 
- Combat will be dangerous, but it will always be fair. All combat encounters are made so that they pose a threat and challenge to the party, but they are never insurmountable.
- You don't need to be optimal in combat. Creative play and team play is rewarded and can lead to higher degrees of success. 
- Some combat encounters will have enemies that are not meant to be taken head-on. These creatures (if present) will be identifiable from the DM's narration. As a party, you always have the option of retreating from a fight or running through/around enemies.
- If a rule is unclear, I will make a ruling and we'll look it up later.

- Your inventory and gold is managed by you. If you don't have an item written down on your sheet, you don't have it.
- Gold conversion is done by you. (barring Electrum which will not be used) each coin of higher value is worth 10 of the previous coin (10CP = 1SP, etc). Gold is very important, and can be given to the party as rewards (or stealing/other means).
- If you are staying at a town/city for more than a day, you must rest at a location at least once a day. Different tiers of accommodation will cost differently, and your choice will have effects such as the party's class, opportunities, or trouble.
- Travel will be affected by the type of transport you have: generally, travel by foot might net more problems/encounters whereas travel by transport will have fewer. Your choice of transportation will also change how you are perceived by others and how rested you are when arriving at your destination.
