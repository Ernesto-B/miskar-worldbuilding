- This world will react to your actions or inactions. NPCs, enemies, and creatures will act while you play. The world will not sit still for the party. 
- Combat will be dangerous, but it will always be fair. All combat encounters are made so that they pose a threat and challenge to the party, but they are never insurmountable.
- You don't need to be optimal in combat. Creative play and team play is rewarded and can lead to higher degrees of success. 
- Some combat encounters will have enemies that are not meant to be taken head-on. These creatures (if present) will be identifiable from the DM's narration. As a party, you always have the option of retreating from a fight or running through/around enemies.
- If a rule is unclear, I will make a ruling and we'll look it up later.

- Your inventory and gold is managed by you. If you don't have an item written down on your sheet, you don't have it.
