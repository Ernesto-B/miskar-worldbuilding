1. **Undos**: you can change or retract anything your characters do up until the point they learn of the consequences. In other words, once I describe what happens as a result of your actions, its too late to change your mind.
2. **Dice Rolls**: Except for the DM's rolls, all dice rolls need to be fully visible by everyone at the table. If a dice falls off the table, it is void and must be re-rolled (only the fallen dice).
3. **AFK'ing**: Ideally, breaks are not taken while in combat. Unless everyone takes a break, someone leaving the table during combat will have their character take the 'Dodge' action while they are away. Furthermore, enemies will not attack that character until the player returns. 
4. **Player responsibilities**: Players will be responsible for:
	1. Reading and becoming familiar with what your class, abilities, attacks, etc do. 
	2. Telling me what your abilities, spells, and attacks do when you use them.
	3. Correctly announcing rolls (applying modifiers, bonuses, etc).
5. **Sensitive or banned topics**: if anyone is uncomfortable with what is being narrated, the scene being played out, anything, you can either stop the scene immediately by making an X with your arms. Otherwise, talk to me after the session or during a break. 
6. **Feedback and suggestions**: After every session, feel free to speak to me or send a dm with any feedback or suggestions you may have. Everyone is more than welcome to share with me what they would like to explore or have an opportunity to do in future sessions.
