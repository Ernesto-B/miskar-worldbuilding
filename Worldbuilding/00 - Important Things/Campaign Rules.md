1. **Undos**: you can change or retract anything your characters do up until the point they learn of the consequences. In other words, once I describe what happens as a result of your actions, its too late to change your mind.
2. **Dice Rolls**: Except for the DM's rolls, all dice rolls need to be fully visible by everyone at the table. If a dice falls off the table, it is void and must be re-rolled (only the fallen dice).
3. **AFK'ing**: 
	1. Ideally, breaks are not taken while in combat. Unless everyone takes a break, someone leaving the table during combat will have their character take the 'Dodge' action while they are away. Furthermore, enemies will not attack that character until the player returns.
	2. AFK'ing during non-combat encounters will result in the character "being off doing their own thing".
	3. If combat begins with an AFK'd player, the encounter will carried out without that character "in play", but initiative for the AFK'd character will be rolled by someone else. If the player comes back and combat is still ongoing, their character will join the battle on their next turn. It is up to party members to catch them up on what they missed. 
4. **Absent Players**: If a player is going to be absent to a session, please let me know in advance so I can plan for it. The character of the absent player will be given an in-game reason for temporarily leaving the party. Any and all XP (milestones) achieved by the present players will also be shared with the absent one. However, rewards/drops might not. 
5. **Player Responsibilities**: On top of normal player roles and responsibilities, players will also be responsible for:
	1. Reading and becoming familiar with what your class, abilities, attacks, etc do. 
	2. Narrate what your abilities, spells, and attacks do when you use them. 
	3. Correctly announcing attack, damage, saving, and skill/ability check rolls (applying modifiers, bonuses, etc).
	4. Speaking up if you think I have made an error regarding rules.
6. **Virtual Sessions**: If/when we have a virtual session, please refrain from DM'ing or otherwise privately communicating with anyone else in the party. All party communication during the session needs to be done through the voice call. Player dice rolls must be either screen shared or clearly shown on camera. If the DM or another player cannot clearly tell what roll you got from the camera, you will be asked to re-roll digitally via screen share.
7. **Sensitive or Banned Topics**: if anyone is uncomfortable with what is being narrated, the scene being played out, anything, you can either stop the scene immediately by making an X with your arms. Otherwise, talk to me after the session or during a break. 
8. **Feedback and Suggestions**: After every session, feel free to speak to me or send a dm with any feedback or suggestions you may have. Everyone is more than welcome to share with me what they would like to explore or have an opportunity to do in future sessions. 


# House Rules
- **Healing Potions**: Healing potions are guaranteed to heal the max amount of healing they can do (instead of rolling). Using a potion requires an *Action*, not a *Bonus Action*.
- **Critical Hits**: Crit damage will be calculated by doing normal damage calculation + adding the maximum amount of damage your weapon can do. Eg longsword does 1d8, so a crit would be 1d8 + 8 (max dmg).
- **Flanking**: We play with the flanking rule. Instead of providing advantage to attack rolls, it instead provides +2 to attack rolls.
- **Underwater**: When dragged underwater, PCs have have 1+CON mod rounds of breath. CON save (DC 10–15). On failure: lose 1 round of breath holding instantly. When out of breath, each round underwater gives one level of exhaustion.
