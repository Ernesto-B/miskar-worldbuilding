# The Adventurer’s Guild of Miskar (DM-Only System Dossier)

## 0) Purpose of this document
This dossier exists to give you a single authoritative “source of truth” for how the Adventurer’s Guild functions as a **world-scale institution** in the Second Age, how it sustains legitimacy across nations, how it interacts with the Celestial Order, and why its internal tensions can plausibly become one of the primary engines of the campaign.

---

## 1) Core Identity

### 1.1 What the Guild is
A **federated, internationally recognized charter network** of adventurer organizations, bound by a shared doctrine and shared operational standards, but not governed as a single nation-state or empire.

- The Guild is not a government.
- The Guild is not a church.
- The Guild is not a mercenary company.
- The Guild is closer to a **cross-border institution**: part crisis-response, part intelligence network, part monster-control apparatus, part relic-handling body, part social pressure valve for volatile talent.

### 1.2 Why it exists (its unavoidable necessity)
The Guild exists because the Second Age world contains threats that cannot be handled reliably by:
- standing armies (too slow, too political, too costly, too blunt)
- local militias (too weak, too frightened, too parochial)
- the Celestial Order (too doctrinal, too controlling, too politically entangled)

Core operational truth:
- The Guild goes where official power cannot go quickly, cannot go cleanly, or cannot admit it needs to go.

### 1.3 Public face vs actual function
**Public face:**  
A respected, semi-heroic institution that “keeps roads safe” and deals with monsters, bandits, ruins, and Grey spillover.

**Actual function:**  
A flexible system that:
- absorbs dangerous people who would otherwise become warlords, rogue mages, or criminals
- maintains shared threat intelligence across borders
- quietly handles missions nations and churches would rather deny
- serves as a pressure-release valve for magic use in a world where magic must be “controlled”

### 1.4 Guild Doctrine
**Motto:** _Light Where It Fails._

Meaning in practice:
- Where law, armies, or doctrine collapse, the Guild must still function.
- Where truth is suppressed, the Guild must still track it.
- Where the Grey or other calamities retreat from official notice, the Guild must still mark the wound.

The motto is more than aesthetic. It produces policies.

---

## 2) The Two Codified Principles (the motto with teeth)
These are official, written, and enforceable in-charter. Branches may bend them, but cannot ignore them without consequence.

### 2.1 No Abandonment
Once a charter accepts a **job-board contract**, the Guild expects completion.

- Withdrawal requires formal justification to the local charter leadership.
- Repeat withdrawals brand an adventurer or party as unreliable.
- Abandonment is one of the fastest paths to being quietly blacklisted from serious contracts.

Why it matters:
- It prevents “Guild is a bunch of freelancers” energy.
- It creates tragedy, heroism, and hard moral calls.
- It makes the Guild feel like an institution, not a tavern board.

### 2.2 No Hoarding of Threats
Sightings and knowledge related to Grey manifestations and major threats must be **logged and shared** across the Guild network.

- Branches can restrict details (location precision, relic specifics), but cannot fully conceal.
- “Threat knowledge” is treated like a shared resource, not private leverage.

Why it matters:
- It explains how the Guild remains globally relevant.
- It fuels internal conflict with nations and the Order.
- It supports the “Starfall tell” folklore.

---

## 3) Structure and Governance

### 3.1 Federated by design
The Guild is **not a centralized empire**. It is federated:
- Each region has its own branches, charters, and local leadership.
- There is a shared doctrine and shared standards.
- Emberhold (the Guild's headquarters) anchors legitimacy, but it does not micromanage every decision.

This federation is intentional because:
- single-point central control is vulnerable to capture by the Celestial Order or a nation
- local threat environments differ radically
- the Guild must survive political shifts and border wars

### 3.2 The “dominant model” and the “background model”
These aren’t slogans. They’re how people internally justify what the Guild is.

**Dominant identity:** _The Necessary Sword_  
Most branches and most citizens believe the Guild exists because someone must fight what armies and priests cannot.

**Background truth:** _The Fracturing Vanguard_  
The Guild is always at risk of splintering because it is federated and because ideology, funding, and fear differ by region.

This duality is critical for Second Age tension. The Guild survives by necessity, but fractures by design pressure.

---

## 4) Emberhold (The Grand Archive / Central Anchor)

### 4.1 What Emberhold is
Emberhold is the neutral anchor of the Guild’s legitimacy and continuity. It is not “the capital of a nation.” It is an institutional heart.

### 4.2 Why Emberhold can exist at all
**Common explanation: Battle Memory.**  
Emberhold sits on ground soaked in the memory of a First Age stand. The story everyone repeats:
- “Here the line held when the world was failing.”
- “Here the Grey broke.”
- “Here something in the land remembers defiance.”

DM implication:
- Can treat Emberhold’s site as a subtle metaphysical anomaly. Not a floating city or magical fortress by default. Just land that refuses to fully yield.

### 4.3 Emberhold’s strategic posture
Emberhold is intentionally:
- on neutral ground
- accessible from many directions
- tied to old roads (even if those roads are broken now)
- resistant to political capture

### 4.4 The Archive function
All official mission ledgers are copied into Emberhold.

- Higher-rank missions especially: Emberhold sends back approvals, sanctions, and intel.
- Emberhold acts as the “long memory” that branches cannot afford to maintain alone.
- Emberhold is the mechanism that turns the Guild into a world system rather than disconnected tavern boards.

### 4.5 Emberhold is also a symbol
Emberhold is “proof” that the Guild is older than modern kings and less fragile than modern laws.

Even people who dislike the Guild tend to accept Emberhold as something you do not violate casually.

---

## 5) Leadership: Aldridge Avalaron and the Guildmaster’s Reality

### 5.1 The Guildmaster
**Aldridge Avalaron** is the current Guildmaster and the human Empyrean Hero who returned from Silent Exile.

Foundational truths:
- He is extremely old, near the end of his life.
- He does not leave Emberhold.
- His presence is rare and significant. When he speaks, it lands like judgement.

### 5.2 Why Aldridge does not leave Emberhold
Practical reasons:
- age and decline
- he is a strategic anchor, not a field actor
- Emberhold is heavily protected by unseen defenses
- acting against him is equivalent to violating an unspoken international treaty
- Obsidian Ranked (2nd highest rank) elites serve as a protective mantle
- the Grey cannot easily root on Emberhold’s ground

Narrative reason:
- Aldridge is the living symbol of “the Guild must remain independent.”

### 5.3 How Aldridge governs (despite being stationary)
Aldridge’s governance travels via three channels:
1. **Writs + Seals**  
    His directives carry weight because:
- they are validated by Emberhold’s authority through seals
- they represent continuity and legitimacy
- they are hard to forge and culturally feared to counterfeit

2. **Envoy-Circles**  
    Rotating envoys from across the world come to Emberhold, receive sealed instruction, and return.
- This creates political drama: who gets chosen as envoy
- It creates intelligence leverage: envoys see Emberhold’s tone and mood
- It creates rumor fuel: “the Guildmaster said…”

3. **Archive Relay**  
    The mission ledger network is a governance tool:
- Emberhold sees patterns
- Emberhold predicts escalations
- Emberhold can sanction branches
- Emberhold can quietly elevate or cripple reputations

This makes Aldridge powerful without requiring him to physically appear.

## 6) Rank System and Advancement

### 6.1 Entry
Anyone can register as an adventurer for a fee of 5 gold.

Exception:
- **Obsidian or Starfall** Ranked adventurers can endorse newcomers into the Guild without the entry fee. Endorsed adventurers can be placed in Silver or Gold rank instead of starting at Bronze. 

### 6.2  Ranks
- **Bronze** - The starting rank. Any surprises during a job/mission can be fatal. Preparedness, information, and mental/emotional hardening is necessary to live.
- **Silver** - Doing jobs in the Grey requires strong mental fortitude. One of the biggest dangers to such adventurers is overconfidence and the Grey itself (mental attacks... becoming dimmed).
- **Gold** - The single greatest obstacle in the way of Gold ranks is their desire to reach Obsidian, and the lack of information. Due to the serious threat level of Gold-ranked issues that arise, information of the issue is often limited, incomplete, or false (completely based on rumors). Despite this, due to the requirement of getting approval from at least two Regional Branch Masters, many Golds die taking jobs that are too ambitious or from lack of information/preparation. Only the most devoted, motivated, powerful, or erratic/eccentric/abnormal peoples attempt to rise in rank. This explains why despite the difficulty of jobs, Gold ranks are still very populated... nobody wants to attempt to advance.
- **Obsidian** - Obsidian is so coveted because it is the highest realistically-obtainable rank anyone in Miskar can hope to achieve.
- **Starfall** - No normal person can ever hope to reach this level. See Starfall section below for more details. 

### 6.3 Contract restrictions
Guild job-board rules:
- Adventurers may take jobs **at their rank or one level below**, not above.
- This prevents systemic job starvation and reduces reckless slaughter at low tiers.

Direct-client rules:
- If an adventurer takes a private contract directly from a client, they are not bound by job-board rank restrictions.
- This creates a moral and regulatory gray zone the Guild cannot fully control.

### 6.4 Payment model
Job-board jobs pay upon verified completion.

Proof examples:
- client seal/letter
- creature remains
- retrieved item
- witness statements or Guild official confirmation

Job-board jobs are typically less lucrative than private client jobs.

### 6.5 Advancement philosophy (anti-greed)
- Often run as group assessments to preserve time.
- Advancement exists, but the Guild must never feel like a predatory machine.
- Costs, if any, are framed as logistical expenses or institutional safeguards, not “buying rank.”

Operational fees for advancement:
- Bronze -> Silver: 50 GP
- Silver -> Gold: 150 GP
- Gold -> Obsidian: 1000 GP + approval from at least 2 Regional Masters
- Obsidian -> Starfall: Appointment by Grandmaster only

Each adventurer must pay a yearly amount to the Guild in order to support operational expenses. The cost is equal to the operational fees for advancement to the adventurer's current level:
- Bronze: 5 GP / yr
- Silver: 50 GP / yr
- Gold: 150 GP / yr
- Obsidian: 1000 GP / yr
- Starfall: ??

Although this is normally reasonable for adventurers, many that become mentally or physically unfit for adventuring (and have no other means of making money) turn to criminal means (extortion of lower ranked adventurers, criminal gangs, illicit activities, etc) to make their money.

### 6.6 The Ashbound
“The Ashbound” is an **unofficial** title for Gold ranked adventurers. 

It is:
- tavern speech
- widow bitterness
- gutter insult
- a cultural warning label for Gold-ranked adventurers who chase Obsidian and die for it

It works because:
- it’s emotionally real
- it’s socially contagious
- it communicates risk better than numbers

## 7) Starfall: Semi-Secret, World-Shifting

### 7.1 What Starfall is
Starfall is not applied for. It is bestowed.

- it is incredibly rare
- ceremonies are minimal or absent
- centuries may pass between acknowledged appointments
- many Starfall exist without the public knowing, but there are only few Starfall in existence. 

### 7.2 Why Starfall is obscure
- scarcity
- lack of public announcement
- Starfall avoid cities, avoid politics, avoid notice
- Starfall often pursue unknown missions

### 7.3 What Starfall means in the world
A single Starfall can shift regional power balances. They are rumored to be about equal in strength to the Heroes of the First Age.

Therefore:
- many nations and the Order prefer Starfall remain mythic
- public awareness is dangerous
- rumor alone can cause panic, envy, or desperate recruitment attempts

### 7.4 Folklore “tells” of Starfall presence
The most common tell is not a symbol or aura. It is **a pattern**:
- taverns hear about a growing Grey amassing or looming catastrophe
- fear spreads
- then suddenly the threat is “written off”
- roads reopen
- caravans resume
- officials act like it never happened

People conclude:
- “Starfall walked.”
- “Someone lit a candle in the fog.”

## 8) The Old-God-Touched Starfall (Subtle Corruption Vector)

### 8.1 Not a servant, not a cultist
This Starfall is not consciously loyal to Old Gods.

They are:
- drawn
- curious
- compelled
- fascinated by the Grey and its relics

### 8.2 The risk vector
**They pursue relics that should stay hidden.**

Why this is dangerous:
- relic recovery can destabilize sealed sites
- relics can be morally ambiguous “solutions”
- relic pursuit can wake sleeping consequences
- relic pursuit can place the Guild into direct collision with the Celestial Order and nations

### 8.3 What this does to the Second Age
This creates an internal pressure:
- Starfall are mythic, so accountability is impossible
- but their actions can have world-scale consequences
- branches will argue whether this Starfall is a blessing or a curse

This is the kind of “slow-burn” fault line that later becomes war.

---

## 9) Relationship with the Celestial Order

### 9.1 Official posture
The Celestial Order publicly tolerates the Guild as a necessary compromise.

Reasons:
- monsters and Grey remnants must be managed
- standing armies cannot cover everything
- the world needs a neutral body to keep roads alive and threats tracked

### 9.2 The actual tension
The Guild fears two things most:
1. **Weaponization**  
    The Order turning the Guild into a church-army.
    
2. **Information Control**  
    The Order censoring archives, shaping truth, and controlling what the world is allowed to remember.

These are existential threats to the Guild’s identity.

### 9.3 Magic licensing reality
Officially:
- the Guild enforces licensing strictly
- magic use is allowed only during official jobs or life-threatening circumstances

In reality:
- adventurers are pragmatic
- magic is used more freely than public doctrine admits
- everyone knows it, especially peasants on the road and soldiers at watchtowers

This produces resentment:
- admired for protection
- resented for exemption behavior
- blamed when things go wrong

### 9.4 Order infiltration
The Order maintains covert influence in the Guild:
- undercover operatives in some branches
- quiet surveillance in archive workflows
- attempts to convert branch leadership gradually
- suppression of certain First Age truths through subtle pressure

### 9.5 The Crown’s posture toward Aldridge
**Patient containment**, with an element of **tentative truce**.

Meaning:
- the Order waits him out to die rather than openly challenging Emberhold
- the Crown avoids provoking a global legitimacy crisis
- but preparations are underway to absorb, dominate, or reshape the Guild when the moment arrives

---

## 10) Funding and International Legitimacy

### 10.1 Why nations support the Guild
Nations fund the Guild because the alternative is worse.

They cannot admit it openly, but they know:
- their borders are not sealed against the Grey
- threats cross boundaries
- relics do not respect laws
- panic spreads faster than armies march

Funding the Guild is:
- insurance
- deterrence
- stabilization policy

### 10.2 Enforcement ladder for underfunding
If a nation underfunds:
1. **Slow Intel**  
    Threat intelligence arrives later.  
    Warnings are delayed.  
    Maps are out of date.

This is plausible deniability. It is not an open punishment, it is “resource reality.”

2. **Embargo via Neutrality**  
    If underfunding persists or becomes hostile:
- the local branch stops taking contracts
- the branch may withdraw entirely if necessary

Why this works:
- it creates immediate domestic consequences
- it forces rulers to explain why roads are less safe
- it pressures merchants and nobles to complain loudly

This is the Guild’s non-military coercion tool.

---

## 11) Succession as the Second Age Fuse

### 11.1 Aldridge’s intent
Aldridge wants the Guild to survive him, and remain wary of Order dominance.

If Order control becomes inevitable:
- he prefers fracture over unity under the Order.

This is not vindictive. It is strategic. A fractured Guild is harder to weaponize.

### 11.2 Aldridge’s “last move”
Aldridge has prepared a **sealed Testament**.

- It defines conditions under which Emberhold recognizes a successor.
- It is secret until his death.
- It will be unveiled after a delay of **one to two weeks**.

Purpose of the delay:
- it allows the Order’s first move to reveal itself
- it prevents immediate capture of the narrative
- it creates a vacuum where factions show their hand

DM note:  
This is one of the best tension devices. It creates:
- suspicion
- scrambling
- loyalty tests
- opportunism
- paranoia
- moral choices

### 11.3 The spark
**Aldridge falls into a long fever and stops issuing directives.**

Immediate implications:
- envoy-circles return without orders
- branches begin improvising
- regional leaders test limits
- nations pressure local branches
- the Order quietly accelerates plans
- rumor spreads that “Emberhold is dark”

This is maximum tension because it:
- destabilizes the Guild
- forces politics to surface
- tests whether federated structure holds or fractures

---

## 12) The Result on the Second Age
Even before we write the prologue tension, your Guild now functions as:
- a **political equilibrium mechanism** (neutrality + embargo + intel)
- an **information organism** (ledgers, relays, archives)
- a **power ladder** (ranks, mythic Starfall)
- a **moral institution** (No Abandonment)
- a **ticking succession crisis** (fever + Testament)

And because the Guild sits between:
- nations
- the Celestial Order
- relic-hunting Starfall
- Grey remnants  
    it naturally becomes the battlefield where Second Age ideology clashes without requiring “a big war” immediately.
