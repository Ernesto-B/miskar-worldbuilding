Created by the [[Grand Wizard Grandale]], The magical Jack-in-a-Box is a powerful magic item containing Wild magic that is unleashed by the Magical being inside the Box known as Jack.

# Lore
The Jack-in-a-Box was made by [[Grand Wizard Grandale]] as a way to control Wild Magic. When he realized that Jack gained sentience and was unable to be controlled, he deemed the project a failure and shelved Jack for a couple decades. The Jack-in-a-Box only left while [[Grand Wizard Grandale]] was moving his place of study where he lost the box containing the [[Magical Jack-in-a-Box]] and other magic items. Out of sheer laziness and just forgetting what was in that box, [[Grand Wizard Grandale]] never tried to look for that lost box and the [[Magical Jack-in-a-Box]] was founded and traded in the underworld before finding it's way into [[Dealer the Gambler]]'s possession.
