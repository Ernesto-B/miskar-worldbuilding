# Description
A tucked away town in the Drakonian forest of Evergreen, mountains scale the horizon, and the dense forest seems endless. At the top of the hill of the trail, you can see through a clearing, a rather large town surrounded by tall 15ft spruce walls with the mountain side posted up against the back of the town. There is a sizable entrance to a mine in the town with smoke coming from behind another gate that separates town from the mines. All the homes and buildings all share the same building materials being all made of lighter spruce than the walls. Each neighborhood is divided by major roads and at the town center, a large courtyard with a large building, beyond that, a large stone church.

# Location
- Merchant Town Next to the mountains
- A bit isolated from the rest of the country due to the mountains cutting the town off from major cities
