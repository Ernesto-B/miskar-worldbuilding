# Session Summary
After defeating [[Big Yoshi]] at the entrance of the [[Mines]] while [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]] gets lost and no one sees him. The party and townspeople, joined by the Knights of the [[Church of the Gains]] venture into the mines where they deal with goblins armed with a cannon in the dark where they met [[Mario Mangione - Arman]] who was looking for a job. The party overcomes the darkened room and opens the door to the next room which is a large open room that was filled with Goblins. With the help from Dealer, the party barely makes it to [[Zhog the Greedy|Zhog]]'s throne while the rest of the townspeople held off the goblins. In the final confrontation, [[Oitt - BK]] charges straight ahead to confront [[Zhog the Greedy|Zhog]] only to be downed and killed by [[Burnie Cinders - Eric]] shooting the [[Dagger of Healing]]. At the climax of the battle, [[Torrent - Kristen]] deals the finishing blow as she decapitates [[Zhog the Greedy|Zhog]] and intimidates the rest of the goblins who flee into the forest. As celebration the party lots some of the gold from [[Zhog the Greedy|Zhog]]'s horde and [[Cheespa - Mateo]] opens the [[Magical Jack-in-a-Box]] as celebration.
