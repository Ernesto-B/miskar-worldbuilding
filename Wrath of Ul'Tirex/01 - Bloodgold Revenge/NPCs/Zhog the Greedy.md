# Zhog's Speech
Do you know what makes you weak? What makes you all weak? 

Your dependency on other people. All of you are so desperately fighting for weaklings like those villagers when you should be fighting for yourselves. You become so complacent with yourselves knowing that someone will do the work for you, that when that wall finally hits you, you simply crumble from the pressure. 

Look where your self imposed "Justice" has gotten you, beaten at my feet, while I am surrounded by riches and crew members that I command.
