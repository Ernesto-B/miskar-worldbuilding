# Overview
After defeating [[Zhog the Greedy|Zhog]] and the [[Bloodgolds]] in Galkoff, the party is called upon by [[Sergeant Reinhardt]] to help oversee and provide security to peace discussions to descale the current war tensions between [[Kingdom of Drakonia|Drakonia]] and [[Grand Republic of Silveid|Silveid]]. The party then travels to the City of  [[Valcove]] where the peace negotiations are taking place. When the party arrives, the [[Duke of Valcove]] holds a ball to welcome the visitors. 

During the party they are introduced to the representatives of [[Kingdom of Drakonia|Drakonia]] and [Silverglade](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VB_-Cl4DZl_ErCsLi1UZicZ1p7rgzFmEouH_CmQiAwk/edit#heading=h.el36wtraimar), Micheal Jackson and other nobles local to [Valcove](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VB_-Cl4DZl_ErCsLi1UZicZ1p7rgzFmEouH_CmQiAwk/edit#heading=h.2p1k52m06n8y) and [[Kingdom of Drakonia|Drakonia]]. While enjoying [[the Ball]], an assassination attempt on the [[Silvalian representative]] leaves them in a coma. Other Silverglade politicians will then accuse the Drakonian’s for setting them up then storming off to tend to their fallen representative. With the shattered trust, [[Sergeant Reinhardt|Reinhardt]] tasks the party with finding out who the attacker is and what is their motive before the representative of Silverglade awakens and leaves Valcove.

The party’s investigation will lead them to find the body of [[Mark Walter 3 - Brian|Mark Walter 3]] and the use of necromancy to control him to attack the [[Silvalian representative]]. Their representative will lead them to find a connection behind the attack and the [[The Hand of the Sacred Flame]] where they confront the [Duke of Valcove](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VB_-Cl4DZl_ErCsLi1UZicZ1p7rgzFmEouH_CmQiAwk/edit#heading=h.r4fyb02399ry) about. The confrontation will then reveal the true attacker was [[Michael Jackson]] who was secretly a necromancer and part of the [Cult of Eirax](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VB_-Cl4DZl_ErCsLi1UZicZ1p7rgzFmEouH_CmQiAwk/edit#heading=h.33ix0258v2lr). 

Depending on the outcome of the battle, the relationship between the nations of Drakonia and Silverglade with either be at war or back to a neutral state.
