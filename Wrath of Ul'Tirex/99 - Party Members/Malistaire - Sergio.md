# Background
## The Call of Death
You were once an ambitious student of the arcane, obsessed with understanding the mysteries of life and death. Born into a modest family in a quiet village, your brilliance quickly earned you a place at a prestigious wizarding academy. While other students were content learning basic spells, you craved something greater--power over life itself.  
  
In your studies, you uncovered an ancient, forbidden tome detailing the secrets of shadow magic. The book spoke of an ancient power, a being known as the Shadow Sovereign, who could command legions of the dead by binding their souls to the void. Against the warnings of your professors, you began experimenting with the spells inside, hoping to unlock this  
forbidden art.

## Awakening
Your moment of transformation came during a tragedy. The village you grew up in was overrun by an undead horde, summoned by a cruel necromancer. You returned to find your family slain and your home in ruins. Filled with rage, you used the shadow spells you had learned to fight back. But something strange happened when you defeated the necromancer--his own shadows bent to your will.  
  
In that moment, you realized the truth: you were not merely a wizard dabbling in necromancy. You were chosen by the shadows themselves, a successor to the Shadow Sovereign. The undead you commanded weren’t lifeless corpses--they were bound to you by an unbreakable loyalty, shadows of their former selves.  
  
The Journey Begins: Now, you wander the world seeking to master your newfound powers. Each time you defeat an enemy, you extract their shadow, growing your army of loyal minions. But this power comes at a cost: whispers of the void haunt your dreams, warning of a coming calamity. You are torn between the desire for ultimate power and the fear that you may lose yourself to the shadows entirely.  
  
As you travel, you’ve begun to attract attention--some see you as a savior, using the shadows to protect the weak. Others see you as a threat, no different from the necromancers you claim to oppose. But your goal remains the same: to become  
strong enough to ensure no one can ever take from you what you’ve lost.
