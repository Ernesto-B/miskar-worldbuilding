# Summary
* The Ascendant Wardens are an elite order tasked with safeguarding the [[Floatstone Towers]] and ensuring the stability of the [[Ascension Zone]]. Their responsibilities include defending the towers from sabotage, monstrous threats and from anyone seeking to harm the towers. Known for their unmatched discipline and skill, the Wardens are apex warriors, trained in aerial combat, land combat, and the secrets of [[floatstone]] technology.
* It is rumored that the winner of Stormhold's Martial Festival is often scouted for recruitment into this prestigious group. This has made the festival a proving ground for those seeking glory and recognition in the Isles.
