# Description
- A fortress-like city in [[Vorynth Island]] built into the cliffs overlooking the [[Black Tides]]. Its defensive walls are reinforced with floatstone, making them resistant to both physical and magical attacks.
- Beneath the city lies the [[Underground Labyrinth]], a sprawling network of tunnels rumored to contain ancient treasures, forgotten monsters, and pathways to other islands. Periodic "dungeon breaks" release these threats into the city, creating a constant need for skilled adventurers.
